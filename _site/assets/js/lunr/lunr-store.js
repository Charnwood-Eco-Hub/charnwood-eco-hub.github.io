        "excerpt":"April 2024 Newsletter      After the huge success of our first Sustainability Fair last year with the support of Charnwood Borough Council, we’ve confirmed the date for this year. This year’s Sustainability Fair will take place on Sunday 29th September in Queen’s Park Loughborough from 10am-3pm. We will have stalls representing a variety of local sustainability and eco groups, including Transition Loughborough, Incredible Edibles, etc. sharing information on their projects, how you can get involved and how you can lower your own carbon footprint, as well as entertainment, workshops and local small businesses selling sustainable products and gifts, like Men &amp; Women in Sheds, Buckingham Bees and Real Refills.  More information will be released closer to the time. If you’re interested in a stall at this year’s fair, please fill in the online form.   This year, we’ll also be running an Eco Christmas market on Sunday 3rd November, in Loughborough Market Place from 10am-2pm.  This will be an ideal opportunity for people to buy sustainable, locally made gifts and crafts, and we’re also hoping to be able to run one or two sustainable Christmas craft workshops on the day. If you’d like a booking form for the Christmas Fair, please fill in this online form.   For more info on either event, or to get involved, please get in touch here or email info@charnwoodecohub.org.   Volunteer of the month - Jennifer Agu      We’d like to do a shout out to our wonderful volunteer Jennifer Agu, a postgraduate student at Loughborough University who approached us a few months ago offering her support. Along with helping us out with social media and loads of other key behind the scenes tasks, Jen is a Sustainability Ambassador for the University’s Sustainability Team and has just been recognised for her outstanding efforts in that role as well (we honestly don’t know how she fits it all in). Thank you for everything you do for us, Jen!  We are always looking for new volunteers, especially if you have expertise in particular areas, but just an extra pair of hands for events and things is welcome too - get in touch to let us know how you could help!      We have some exciting plans in the offing, and we would love to hear what you think about them! We are currently involved in talks with another local charity about an exciting collaboration that will involve setting up a physical Eco Hub in Loughborough, out of which we hope to operate a Tool Library, Makerspace (or Hackspace) and a Scrapstore, as well as offering a space for local eco/sustainability groups to hold meetings and small events or workshops. We would love to hear what you think about our idea, and gather some feedback on how you would use the space, either as an individual or as an organisation.  You can fill in our online survey here. Please do share the link widely, as the more feedback we can get the better! If you’re interested in getting involved in this project, please do get in touch, we’d love to hear from you! To learn more about what a Scrapstore is, take a look at this video all about Cardiff Scrapstore.   Charnwood Eco Hub holds networking event for local eco groups      Charnwood Eco Hub recently held a networking event for local groups involved in projects that support sustainability or protect and enhance the local environment. More than 15 groups were in attendance on the day, including  Incredible Edible, Transition Loughborough, Loughborough University, Loughborough Climate Action and Barrow Greener Living Group. The event was intended to offer local groups the opportunity to make connections and talk about potential cross over and collaborations. The idea was conceived after last year’s inaugural Sustainability Fair, where the various groups who ran stalls at the event were so overwhelmed with enquiries from the public that they didn’t get the opportunity to chat with each other. We also had a representative from Charnwood Borough Council along,chatting to groups about potential funding opportunities for their activities and projects. If you’re involved with a local eco group and would like to be included on our mailing list to be kept informed of future events, or would like us to share information about your group and events on our website or Facebook page, please get in touch.   Loughborough’s Beacon Bingo Hall listed as asset of community value      Charnwood Eco Hub has successfully applied to Charnwood Borough Council to list the former Beacon Bingo Hall as a community asset.  Originally opened as a cinema in 1936 as part of the Odeon cinema chain, the building was subsequently converted to a social club in 1969, after which it became a bingo hall, until its eventual closure in 2021. In order to qualify as a community asset, a building must have been used for community benefit in the recent past. Its listing means that should the owners decide to sell, local community organisations are given the opportunity to put a bid together to buy it. Listing a property doesn’t prevent the sale of the building, nor does it limit the use that it can be put to by the current owners.   The building is also Grade II listed as a building of architectural significance – it is a remarkably well preserved and accomplished example of the 1930s modernist cinema style employed by the Odeon cinema chain, at that time, style leaders in cinema design. The small car park adjacent to the Bing Hall has recently been opened as a pay and display car park, creating valuable additional town centre parking spaces.   A representative of Charnwood Eco Hub, who applied for the building to be listed, said, “The former Beacon Bingo hall is an iconic building. We asked for it to be listed as a community asset so that if the current owners ever decide to sell, the community has an option to put a bid together to offer to buy it on behalf of the town and maintain its use for the social benefit of local residents, which has been its sole purpose up to this point. So many socially historic buildings have been converted into flats or offices, and whilst we’d of course rather see this beautiful building put to any use rather than allowed to fall into disrepair, it would be amazing if it could continue to be a community space. We would love to hear what people’s favourite memories are of the building.” Contact us to share your memories of the Beacon Bingo Hall.   Volunteer with us!      We’re looking for volunteers to join us at the Eco Hub in a wide variety of roles, including customer service, admin, social media &amp; marketing, and tech support, and we’d love to welcome you to the team!

Clive has been a director at DIAM, an international manufacturer of tailor-made POS solutions for over 30 years, so brings a wealth of experience to our little board. He’s also a part time tinkerer, and he’ll also be taking responsibility for the Makerspace project in our new Eco Hub, and it couldn’t be in safer hands!   Charnwood Eco Hub / SOFA collab update!      We’re really excited to announce that we’ve signed a collaboration agreement with SOFA, the furniture reuse charity based in the old Towles Mill building on Nottingham Road in Loughborough. SOFA have offered us  space on the first floor of the building from which to run our tool library, makerspace and scrapstore projects, and we’re applying for grants to fund the structural work we need to do internally to make the space safe and secure and ready for business. Watch this space for updates on the build and a launch date!      A group of local refill shops have set up The Leicestershire Refill Collective and have launched a website to help residents in the county shop more sustainably. By visiting the website - here - you can find out where your nearest refill shop is. It’s a great idea, and we’ll also be sharing a link to the website from the Charnwood Eco Hub website.

Solar Together      Considering solar panels for your home or business but don’t know where to start?    Thanks to the “Solar Together” scheme, installing solar panels on your rooftop has become easier than ever.   The new round of the scheme is now open for registration in Charnwood, allowing more residents to benefit from solar panels and battery storage.   Charnwood Borough Council is working in partnership with councils across Leicestershire to offer you the chance to generate your own clean electricity at a highly competitive price. By installing solar panels and producing renewable electricity for your home or business, you will be playing your part in supporting our shared ambition to reduce carbon emissions in Leicestershire.   The Council has partnered with independent experts in group-buying, iChoosr Ltd, to bring this opportunity to Charnwood’s homeowners.   Solar Together Leicestershire is an innovative scheme offering high-quality solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and battery storage. It is a group-buying scheme, which brings Leicestershire households together to get high-quality solar panels at a competitive price, helping you through the process and keeping you informed at every stage.   Registration for this round closes on Friday August 9, 2024.   Find out more about how the scheme works, who is eligible, and how to register by visiting the Solar Together website.   Find out more and how to apply      To support Leicestershire residents with their energy bills, regional charity Groundwork Five Counties is offering their FREE Green Doctor service, with home appointments now available to book.   These energy efficiency experts identify and tackle damp, mould, heat loss, leaks, and other issues in your home. They give bespoke advice that works for you, along with energy-saving measures such as LED bulbs, draught-proofing items, and more - to save further money on your energy bills.   If you are eligible, they can also help you access emergency heating, government grants for large purchases (incl. boiler replacement, solar panels, improved insulation), support you with debts, and more. They are a fount of knowledge around local support available that may be helpful to you, and you are sure to be happy with their service and advice.   In autumn, Tracy received a visit from a Green Doctor who advised she turn down her boiler temperature and flow and set her thermostat to a constant 18 degrees rather than turning it on high when she comes in from the cold.   Tracy used to pay £1 a day for her gas, but after the Green Doctor visited she only paid 14 pence per day, allowing her to save hundreds of pounds over the year! This means Tracy can now use the money she saved to do fun activities with her grandchildren during the summer.   You too can get a FREE Green Doctor visit, find out more and book your home visit: https://www.groundwork.org.uk/fivecounties/green-doctor/      Are you a community group focused around nature?

        "title": "Charnwood Eco Hub October 2024 Newsletter",
        "excerpt":"October 2024 Newsletter   Hello! Where did last month go?! And how is it only two months ‘til Christmas? No sooner had we finished getting everything ready for the Sustainability Fair, were we into last minute preparations for next month’s Christmas Eco Market - if you haven’t heard about that yet, see the article below, it’s going to be brilliant. We’ve also been busy bees behind the scenes planning and prepping for the Eco Hub - more on that to come soon!   2nd annual Charnwood Sustainability Fair is a success!      Sunday 29th September saw the 2nd annual Charnwood Sustainability Fair take place in Queen’s Park, Loughborough. Over 30 stalls participated, including local craftspeople selling sustainable handmade gifts, local groups such as Transition Loughborough, Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free and Incredible Edible offering advice on how to live more sustainably, national and local environmental charities like the Trent Rivers Trust sharing information on their activities, and entertainment from local performers The Quorn Ukulele Orchestra, Bare Bones Women’s Morris Dancers and Sing It Happy choir.   This year for the first time food was available, from new local community interest company Turnip Point - who make delicious dishes out of food otherwise destined for landfill - and Food for Future, who were hosting cookery demonstrations on how to cook vegan on a budget with seasonal produce. Fun and educational family activities were provided by Parents for Future. Charnwood Borough Council, who supported the event, were also present, with 500 native trees to give away to residents to plant at home.   We’re really pleased that the event went so well and particularly that the weather held – Mother Nature must have been smiling on us! It was great to see so many people at the event - even more than last year - and chatting to stall holders, who said they had some really positive conversations. One of the aims of Charnwood Eco Hub is to bring local groups working towards sustainability together, and help them to share information on their activities with residents, so we’re delighted that so many people engaged, and we’re already making plans for next year. We’d also like to thank Charnwood Borough Council for supporting this event.   Charnwood Eco Hub/SOFA collab October update!      Things are moving along nicely with our Eco Hub fit out project, and we hope to get started on getting some walls up soon! We met with the trustees at SOFA last month to give them an update on our progress, and everyone was very excited to hear about our plans. Clive is busy drawing up floor plans, and we have been contacting/visiting local organisations organisations and businesses, for support either as donors or collaborators. We hope to have something to show you next month - Watch this space!   Christmas Eco Market      Our next event is a Christmas Eco Market, which will take place in Loughborough Market Place (using the new permanent covered market stalls) on Sunday November 3rd from 10am-3pm. Charnwood Borough Council will be there giving away trees again, which always draws a crowd, we hope to have some Christmas-themed entertainment, and we’ll be offering an eco gift-wrapping service. We are particularly looking for stalls selling ethical/sustainable Christmas gifts, and vegetarian/vegan food stalls - If you’d like to come, you can book a stall here.   Transition Potato Day 2025      Gardeners of Loughborough: it is time to start making your Potato Day orders for the 2025 season!  We are once again partnering with Transition Chesterfield to offer a range of seed potatoes, onions, shallots, garlic, beans, peas, green manure seeds and other veg growing sundries. You can pre-order from today until Tuesday 12th November 2024 if you want to take advantage of the widest range of options and lowest prices.   As usual pre-ordered items will be collected from Chesterfield in January by the Transition Loughborough volunteers, bagged up and then distributed on Saturday 25th January 2025 from John Storer House.  Full details, and the link to the ordering website at Transition Chesterfield are on our Potato Day 2025 web page.   Remember: you have to place your orders by Tuesday 12th November 2024 – no orders will be accepted after that date because Transition Chesterfield will be sending the total order amounts of potatoes, sets, and seeds to their suppliers. The deadline is a little earlier this year because the suppliers have already said there are limited stocks of some varieties due to the poor weather experienced by some farmers earlier in the year, so we need to “get in quick”! Please don’t get caught out – order as soon as you can!   Support us and win with Charnwood Community Lottery!      You can now support us and also be in with a chance of winning by buying tickets for Charnwood Community Lottery.  At least 60% from each ticket sold goes to support Charnwood, and there’s a chance to win the £25,000 jackpot every week! You can purchase tickets and support us  here.   Introducing: Turnip Point      We’re excited to introduce Turnip Point, a community-driven social enterprise that’s on a mission to tackle food waste and support those in need across Charnwood. Our approach? Simple – we rescue surplus food, turn it into innovative meals, and share it with the community through various concepts, making healthy, innovative, delicious food accessible to all.   Our recent launch event at the Charnwood Eco Hub Sustainability Fair on 29th September at Queens Park was a fantastic start! It was the perfect way to introduce ourselves to the community, and the response was incredible. With the help of Fareshare, Wonky Veg, who generously donated a box of produce, and some local traders we managed to save 120kg of food that would have otherwise gone to waste.   The money raised from each event goes directly into growing Turnip Point, allowing us to host more community events, provide more delicious food offerings, and help even more people through our free community lunches and dinners. Our mission is to keep spreading sustainability and community spirit with every meal we serve! All support on our journey is very much appreciated - You can support our crowdfunder here.   What’s Next? We’re excited to announce our next event at the Hub Project on Market Street (Loughborough) on Monday, 7th October from 12-2 PM. This pay-as-you-please lunch is open to everyone! Come enjoy our delicious meat and veggie options made from surplus ingredients, and take the opportunity to see the fantastic work the Hub Project is doing inside for the local community. It’s first come, first serve, so come down early to grab a meal, enjoy some good food, and be part of something bigger. And don’t worry if you miss it, we’ll be back at the next Charnwood Eco Hub Sustainability Fair in November.   Follow us, join the movement, and let’s make a real difference together! We can’t wait to see you at our next event!   www.turnippoint.co.uk   International Repair Day 2024 - Saturday 19th October      Repairing things isn’t always easy – especially with electricals and electronics! It’s often hard to get spare parts; there are limited instructions; items aren’t made to last and some are impossible to take apart without breaking them. This isn’t just frustrating, it’s bad for our bank balances and the planet.  On Saturday 19 October 2024 we will celebrate the eighth edition of International Repair Day, a day to promote and celebrate the value of fixing. We’ve signed the Repair and Reuse declaration, calling on policymakers to make it easier for items to be repaired. If you run a repair cafe or repair group, please consider signing it.   Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free have organised a special International Repair Day Repair Cafe in Woodhouse Eaves Village Hall on the day from 9.30am-12.30pm, and we’ll be making a special announcement on the day ourselves, so keep an eye on our social media!

Christmas Eco Market   Our Christmas Eco Market will take place in Loughborough Market Place this Sunday November 3rd from 10am-3pm, and we’re feeling the festive spirit! We have 30+ local, sustainable makers and craftspeople confirmed, selling an array of wonderful planet friendly handmade products that your friends and family will love to receive as gifts. Charnwood Borough Council will be giving away free native trees, we have Christmas-themed entertainment from Sing It Happy Choir and the Folk Folk, and we’ll be offering an eco gift-wrapping service.      A community fridge is a space that’s dedicated to recycling surplus fresh food and stopping it from going to waste.   Unlike conventional food banks, a fridge is open to all, and anyone can contribute to, or use food from the fridge. Sources include food from supermarkets, local food businesses, producers, households and gardens.   Charnwood Community Fridge are planning to make Christmas-New Year food bags for families in need, especially pensioners and those who we are not entitled to get support from elsewhere. To continue their collective commitment to recycling and green living, they are looking for donated fabrics so that their volunteers can make bags out of them.   They would be very grateful if you could support them by donating either surplus or used fabrics still in good condition. Together we can make the world greener and our community more resilient especially in a difficult time like this!   To donate, please contact Shelthorpe Family Hub on 0116 305 5247 (Mon-Fri, 9am-3pm)      We’ve had our first winner!   Support us, and you could also be in with a chance of winning by buying tickets for Charnwood Community Lottery.  At least 60% from each ticket sold goes to support Charnwood, and there’s a chance to win the £25,000 jackpot every week! You can purchase tickets and support us  here.      Buy Nothing New Month   Could you buy nothing new for just one month?   From the water and energy used in production, to the fuel used in delivery, every new item we buy comes with an environmental price tag.   Buy Nothing New Month returns this November as we call on Brits to boycott Black Friday and the culture of impulse buys that goes along with it. Instead, we want to waste less, make the most of the stuff we already own, and cut our carbon footprint by buying nothing new – excluding essentials like food and medicine – throughout November.   Save your pennies, protect the planet, and sign up for Buy Nothing New Month today.      Climate Ambassadors Introduction  Nov 14th 12.30pm to 1.30pm   Staff &amp; students of DeMontfort University and community members are invited to learn about becoming a ‘Climate Ambassador’, part of a UK-wide network who care about sustainability and helping local schools and nurseries to act on climate change.

        "excerpt":"December 2024 Newsletter   Welcome to the December Edition of the Charnwood Eco Hub Newsletter!   The holiday season is upon us, and we’re wrapping up (sorry) the year with exciting updates and events to share with you. December is a busy time for us at the Eco Hub, and we’re thrilled to invite you to join us in spreading some sustainable holiday cheer!   This month, we’re involved in some wonderful events, including an Eco Craft Workshop at Waitrose’s Christmas Shopping Evening on the 12th December, we’ll be offering an Eco Gift Wrapping service at Fearon Hall’s Vegan Cafe on 7th December, and also at the Gardener’s Fair on 8th December.   This newsletter is packed with updates on our progress, recent events, and how you can get involved. Thank you for being part of our community as we work together to create a greener, more sustainable Charnwood.   Wishing you a joyful and eco-friendly holiday season!      From top left: The dividers going up at SOFA, our eco elf workshop, our tree at All Saints Christmas Tree Festival, Our last Eco Hub Social, paint donation from B &amp; Q.      Exciting Progress at Charnwood Eco Hub!   The Eco Hub is taking shape, and we’re excited to share some updates on our progress!   Over the past few weeks, our team has been hard at work constructing walls to define our spaces and make the hub more functional for community activities. We’ve also started installing racking, which will help us organise materials and resources effectively as we prepare to open our doors.   And the most exciting news? We now have a launch date! We’ll be unveiling the Eco Hub to the community early in the New Year - date to be revealed in our next newsletter!   This project has been a labour of love, powered by generous donations, grants, and the unwavering support of our volunteers and partners. The hub will be a space for creativity, innovation, education, collaboration, and action, helping Charnwood embrace a greener, more sustainable future.   Stay tuned for more updates as we count down to the big day. We can’t wait to welcome you to your new Eco Hub!      A Festive Success: Last Month’s Christmas Eco Market   Last month’s Christmas Eco Market was a resounding success, and we couldn’t be more thrilled with the outcome! With over 30 fantastic stalls showcasing sustainable, handmade, and eco-friendly goods, the event offered something for everyone, from unique gifts to delicious treats.   The community came out in full force, with over 2,400 people attending throughout the day. The bustling atmosphere was filled with holiday cheer, and it was inspiring to see so many people supporting local businesses and embracing sustainable shopping.   Highlights included live music from Sing It Happy choir and The Folk Folk, an eco-friendly gift wrapping service, and fresh hot food from our friends at Turnip Point.   A huge thank you to everyone who helped make this event possible—our volunteers, stallholders, and attendees. Your enthusiasm and support make all the difference. Together, we’ve shown how sustainability and festive spirit can go hand in hand!   We’re already looking forward to next year’s event - if you’re a stallholder and you’d like to book, click here. Stay tuned for more updates and initiatives to keep the eco-friendly momentum going!      Support us while you shop!   Looking for an easy way to make a difference this holiday season? With Easyfundraising, you can support Charnwood Eco Hub while doing your Christmas shopping online—at no extra cost to you!   Easyfundraising partners with thousands of retailers, from Amazon to John Lewis, so every time you make a purchase, a small donation is sent to our cause. It’s a simple and effective way to help fund our projects while ticking off your holiday gift list.   Signing up is quick and free. Just visit Easyfundraising, select Charnwood Eco Hub as your cause, and shop as usual. Let’s make this season of giving truly impactful! If you’d rather just donate, you can do so by donating to our Justgiving page here.      As the festive season approaches, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement and excesses of Christmas. However, with a little thought and creativity, you can enjoy the holidays while reducing waste, cutting emissions, and protecting our beautiful planet. Here are some simple yet impactful ways to make your Christmas sustainable, brought to you by Charnwood Eco Hub.   1. Rethink Your Decorations   Instead of buying new decorations each year, consider using natural, recyclable, or homemade alternatives. Pinecones, dried oranges, cinnamon sticks, and sprigs of holly or evergreen branches make beautiful, biodegradable ornaments. Visit our tree at All Saints’ Christmas Tree Festival for inspiration! If you have existing decorations, treasure them—they’re often more meaningful and sustainable than mass-produced alternatives.   2. Choose Eco-Friendly Wrapping   The UK generates a staggering amount of waste during Christmas, much of it from wrapping paper. Opt for recyclable kraft paper, reusable fabric wraps, or even old maps and newspapers to wrap your gifts. Skip the glitter—it’s non-recyclable—and finish with natural twine or a reusable ribbon. Or come along to one of our eco gift wrapping sessions (see what’s on below) and let us wrap them for you!   3. Give Thoughtful, Sustainable Gifts   Support local artisans, ethical brands, or give experiences instead of physical gifts. Think workshop vouchers, concert tickets, or a donation to a charity in the recipient’s name. Homemade gifts like jams, baked goods, or knitted scarves can also add a personal and eco-conscious touch.   4. Feast Sustainably   A Christmas feast can be both delicious and eco-friendly. Plan portions carefully to avoid food waste, source ingredients locally, and consider a plant-based menu or dishes. If you have leftovers, get creative with recipes or share them with neighbors and friends.   5. Reduce Energy Usage   Lighting adds a magical touch to Christmas, but it can also use significant energy. Switch to LED fairy lights, and put them on a timer to reduce consumption. Turn off unnecessary lights and appliances to conserve energy while enjoying the holiday glow.   6. Rent, Don’t Buy   If you’re hosting and need extra furniture, crockery, or even outfits, consider renting instead of purchasing new items that might only be used once. Many local rental services offer beautiful and functional items for a fraction of the cost—and environmental impact—of buying new.   7. Opt for a Sustainable Tree   Real trees, when responsibly sourced from local growers, are generally more eco-friendly than artificial ones. Look for FSC-certified trees, or consider renting a living tree that can be replanted after the holidays. If you already have an artificial tree, the best thing you can do is keep using it for as many years as possible.   8. Recycle and Repurpose   Once the festivities are over, recycle what you can and repurpose decorations for next year. Compost your natural tree or check if your council offers a tree recycling scheme. By properly sorting waste, you ensure that materials are reused and kept out of landfills.   9. Spread Awareness (and joy!)   Encourage friends and family to adopt sustainable practices. Share tips, exchange ideas, and make eco-conscious decisions part of your festive traditions. Together, small changes can lead to a big impact.      Thank You to Our Generous Donors!   We’re thrilled to share our gratitude with B&amp;Q and Loughborough University for their incredible support of Charnwood Eco Hub!   Thanks to B&amp;Q’s generous donation of paint, we’ve been able to refresh and brighten up our space, creating a more welcoming environment for our community projects.   A heartfelt thank you also goes to Loughborough University for their invaluable contributions of chairs and an extractor unit. These donations will make our hub even more functional and comfortable for everyone who visits.   If your organisation may be able to donate something we can use, please get in touch.

Julian Rees will give a talk on the importance of looking after our soil.   A handful of healthy soil contains more living organisms than all the humans that have ever lived.  It stores more carbon than the atmosphere and all plants and animals combined.  It is essential to providing our food.  Yet we are losing it at a terrifying rate.  Globally we lose 24 billion tonnes per year.  Understanding soil is fundamental to growing healthy, nutritious food.   After a talk on soil and how to keep it healthy, we will look at some samples of different soils, pick it up, run it through our fingers, look at it, smell it, discuss texture and colour.   No charge, but donations to cover costs will be appreciated. Please arrive early.  Bring gardening gloves if you can but we can provide.  Booking essential.  Email on ediblelboro@gmail.com to book.   Parking around Fearon Hall is limited. Best option is to park under Tesco’s in The Rushes and walk up, leaving 5 minutes or more for the walk.

Leicestershire County Council Launches Waste Prevention Map   This new interactive map hosted on the County Council website includes organisations that provide refill options on food and drinks, repairers such as fixer groups and other organisations in the community (like us!) that support a move to a more local circular economy where waste is eliminated and products are kept in use for longer.   A spokesperson for the County Council said, “We know sometimes it is difficult to find a service near you without lots of searching, so we have created this map so you can find the services you need across Leicestershire.”   Leicestershire County Council has recently launched a new waste prevention map to help residents find their nearest repair cafe, refill shop or eco group.  The map shows organisations that are based in Leicestershire who help people to;      Reduce   Reuse   Refill   Prevent Waste   If you belong to a Leicestershire-based organisation that fits one of these categories, and you’re not on the map, you can add your group by filling in the application form here.      Calling all gardeners: Transition Loughborough are holding another of their popular seed share events at Fearon Hall!   This will take place in the morning on Saturday 1st March 2025 and will coincide with a vegan cafe popping up in the Hall serving breakfasts, so you can do some seed sharing and eat some plants at the same time.   For those who have not been before, a seed sharing event is when local people bring unwanted seeds they have, put them on tables and then look at other seeds people have put down. Any that take your fancy you can have. You can bring 1 packet and take 10, or bring 10 and take 1, and the seeds can be self-saved ones or out of date, partially used or unwanted commercial seed packets. Its a great way to thin out your excess old seeds stock and potentially pick up some seeds to try out for free. No money changes hands for the seed swap itself, though you’ll need to buy your breakfast at the Fearon Hall cafe.      Applications Open!   Planning ahead for a greener future?

Over his career, he has played a major role in helping to promote the importance of sustainability issues to government, the private sector and amongst the general public. He has provided strategic advice to leading UK and international companies to deepen their understanding of today’s converging environmental and climate crises.   He is also focused on intergenerational justice, supporting young people in their activities around sustainable development issues as they face a future defined by the twin crises of the Climate Emergency and Biodiversity Emergency.   Jonathon was formerly Co-Chair of the Green Party (1980-83) and Director of Friends of the Earth (1984-90). He stood down as Chair of the UK Sustainable Development Commission in 2009, after nine years providing high-level advice to Government Ministers.   Jonathon was awarded a CBE in January 2000 for services to environmental protection.   In his guest lecture at Loughborough University, Jonathon will discuss the criminalisation of environmental protest, looking at instances of arrests, imprisonment and similar in cases such as Just Stop Oil in the UK and beyond.   Students, staff and members of the public are all welcome to attend. There will be an opportunity for questions during the event. Please submit any questions you may have in advance.

        "excerpt":"Charnwood Eco Hub recently held a networking event for local groups involved in projects that support sustainability or protect and enhance the local environment      More than 15 groups were in attendance on the day, including  Incredible Edible, Transition Loughborough, Loughborough University, Loughborough Climate Action and Barrow Greener Living Group.   The event was intended to offer local groups the opportunity to make connections and talk about potential cross over and collaborations. The idea was conceived after last year’s inaugural Sustainability Fair, where the various groups who ran stalls at the event were so overwhelmed with enquiries from the public that they didn’t get the opportunity to chat with each other.   We also had a representative from Charnwood Borough Council along,chatting to groups about potential funding opportunities for their activities and projects.   If you’re involved with a local eco group and would like to be included on our mailing list to be kept informed of future events, or would like us to share information about your group and events on our website or Facebook page, please get in touch.

        "title": "Loughborough's Beacon Bingo Hall listed as asset of community value",
        "excerpt":"Charnwood Eco Hub has successfully applied to Charnwood Borough Council to list the former Beacon Bingo Hall as a community asset      Originally opened as a cinema in 1936 as part of the Odeon cinema chain, the building was subsequently converted to a social club in 1969, after which it became a bingo hall, until its eventual closure in 2021. In order to qualify as a community asset, a building must have been used for community benefit in the recent past. Its listing means that should the owners decide to sell, local community organisations are given the opportunity to put a bid together to buy it. Listing a property doesn’t prevent the sale of the building, nor does it limit the use that it can be put to by the current owners.   The building is also Grade II listed as a building of architectural significance – it is a remarkably well preserved and accomplished example of the 1930s modernist cinema style employed by the Odeon cinema chain, at that time, style leaders in cinema design. The small car park adjacent to the Bing Hall has recently been opened as a pay and display car park, creating valuable additional town centre parking spaces.   A representative of Charnwood Eco Hub, who applied for the building to be listed, said, “The former Beacon Bingo hall is an iconic building. We asked for it to be listed as a community asset so that if the current owners ever decide to sell, the community has an option to put a bid together to offer to buy it on behalf of the town and maintain its use for the social benefit of local residents, which has been its sole purpose up to this point. So many socially historic buildings have been converted into flats or offices, and whilst we’d of course rather see this beautiful building put to any use rather than allowed to fall into disrepair, it would be amazing if it could continue to be a community space. We would love to hear what people’s favourite memories are of the building.” Contact us to share your memories of the Beacon Bingo Hall.   ","categories": [],

Over 30 stalls participated, including local craftspeople selling sustainable handmade gifts, local groups such as Transition Loughborough, Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free and Incredible Edible offering advice on how to live more sustainably, national and local environmental charities like the Trent Rivers Trust sharing information on their activities, and entertainment from local performers The Quorn Ukulele Orchestra, Bare Bones Women’s Morris Dancers and Sing It Happy choir. This year for the first time food was available, from new local community interest company Turnip Point - who make delicious dishes out of food otherwise destined for landfill - and Food for Future, who were hosting cookery demonstrations on how to cook vegan on a budget with seasonal produce. Fun and educational family activities were provided by Parents for Future. Charnwood Borough Council, who supported the event, were also present, with 500 native trees to give away to residents to plant at home.   We’re really pleased that the event went so well and particularly that the weather held – Mother Nature must have been smiling on us! It was great to see so many people at the event - even more than last year - and chatting to stall holders, who said they had some really positive conversations. One of the aims of Charnwood Eco Hub is to bring local groups working towards sustainability together, and help them to share information on their activities with residents, so we’re delighted that so many people engaged, and we’re already making plans for next year. We’d also like to thank Charnwood Borough Council for supporting this event.   ","categories": [],

If you’re quick and make more than two, you’re welcome to keep them or take any unfinished ones home.   All materials will be provided, including pre-cut fabric, thread, and official Morsbag labels. Please bring your own fabric scissors if you have them. An iron and ironing board will be available at the venue.   Important Info:   🧵 Basic sewing experience is required – you should be comfortable using a sewing machine and rethreading it if needed. The sewing itself is simple (straight lines), but this session is not suitable for complete beginners.   👥 Ages 18+ only.   🧷 Sewing machines are available at the venue; workshop numbers will be limited accordingly.   ♻️ Morsbags are a fantastic way to reduce single-use plastic. Each one is unique, washable, and designed to last for years.   Let’s sew, chat, and make a real difference – one bag at a time!   The workshop costs £15 per person and includes all materials.
