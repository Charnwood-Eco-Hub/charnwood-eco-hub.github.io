<p><em>Hello! Apologies for going missing for a month, but we have been super busy and have lots of news for you….we hope you’ll forgive us once you see what we’ve been up to!</em></p>

<h1 id="charnwood-sustainability-fair">Charnwood Sustainability Fair</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/charnwood-sustainability-fair-2024.png" alt="Charnwood Sustainability Fair 2024 poster" /></p>

<p>It’s not too late to get involved with this year’s Sustainability fair - whether you’d liek to run a workshop or activity for us, or volunteer to steward we have roles for everyone!</p>

<p>For more info or to get involved, please get in touch <a href="mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org">here</a> or email <a href="mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org">info@charnwoodecohub.org</a>.</p>

<h1 id="say-hello-to-our-new-director">Say hello to our new director!</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/clive-bagley.jpg" alt="Clive Bagley" /></p>

<p>We’re really pleased to introduce our new director, Clive Bagley. Clive has been a director at DIAM, an international manufacturer of tailor-made POS solutions for over 30 years, so brings a wealth of experience to our little board. He’s also a part time tinkerer, and he’ll also be taking responsibility for the Makerspace project in our new Eco Hub, and it couldn’t be in safer hands!</p>

<h1 id="charnwood-eco-hub--sofa-collab-update">Charnwood Eco Hub / SOFA collab update!</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/sofa-building-eco-hub-site.png" alt="Photo showing where the Eco Hub will be based in the SOFA building" /></p>

<p>We’re really excited to announce that we’ve signed a collaboration agreement with SOFA, the furniture reuse charity based in the old Towles Mill building on Nottingham Road in Loughborough. SOFA have offered us  space on the first floor of the building from which to run our tool library, makerspace and scrapstore projects, and we’re applying for grants to fund the structural work we need to do internally to make the space safe and secure and ready for business. Watch this space for updates on the build and a launch date!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/welcome-message.png" alt="Refill Collective logo" /></p>

<p>A group of local refill shops have set up The Leicestershire Refill Collective and have launched a website to help residents in the county shop more sustainably. By visiting the website - <a href="https://hello721653.wixsite.com/therefillcollective">here</a> - you can find out where your nearest refill shop is. It’s a great idea, and we’ll also be sharing a link to the website from the Charnwood Eco Hub website.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/charnwood-eco-hub-wants-to-hear-from-you.png" alt="We want to hear from you!" /></p>

<p>We still need more responses to our eco hub survey - we would love to hear what you think about our ideas, and gather some feedback on how you would potentially use the space, either as an individual or as an organisation.  You can fill in our online survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeunNy8gA1OsdnYPz8d7KdB6WS-FWnLnyFCXdhRkUbLU5cR7A/viewform">here</a>. Please do share the link widely, as the more feedback we can get the better! If you’re interested in getting involved in this project, please do <a href="mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org">get in touch</a>, we’d love to hear from you!</p>

<h1 id="solar-together">Solar Together</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/img/solar-together-installation.jpg" alt="Solar panel installation photo" /></p>

<p>Considering solar panels for your home or business but don’t know where to start? </p>

<p>Thanks to the “Solar Together” scheme, installing solar panels on your rooftop has become easier than ever.</p>

<p>The new round of the scheme is now open for registration in Charnwood, allowing more residents to benefit from solar panels and battery storage.</p>

<p>Charnwood Borough Council is working in partnership with councils across Leicestershire to offer you the chance to generate your own clean electricity at a highly competitive price. By installing solar panels and producing renewable electricity for your home or business, you will be playing your part in supporting our shared ambition to reduce carbon emissions in Leicestershire.</p>

<p>The Council has partnered with independent experts in group-buying, iChoosr Ltd, to bring this opportunity to Charnwood’s homeowners.</p>

<p>Solar Together Leicestershire is an innovative scheme offering high-quality solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and battery storage. It is a group-buying scheme, which brings Leicestershire households together to get high-quality solar panels at a competitive price, helping you through the process and keeping you informed at every stage.</p>

<p>Registration for this round closes on <strong>Friday August 9, 2024</strong>.</p>

<p>Find out more about how the scheme works, who is eligible, and how to register by visiting the Solar Together website.</p>

<p><a href="https://solartogether.co.uk/charnwood/home">Find out more and how to apply</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/five-counties-logo.png" alt="Groundwork Five Counties logo" /></p>

<p>To support Leicestershire residents with their energy bills, regional charity Groundwork Five Counties is offering their FREE Green Doctor service, with home appointments now available to book.</p>

<p>These energy efficiency experts identify and tackle damp, mould, heat loss, leaks, and other issues in your home. They give bespoke advice that works for you, along with energy-saving measures such as LED bulbs, draught-proofing items, and more - to save further money on your energy bills.</p>

<p>If you are eligible, they can also help you access emergency heating, government grants for large purchases (incl. boiler replacement, solar panels, improved insulation), support you with debts, and more. They are a fount of knowledge around local support available that may be helpful to you, and you are sure to be happy with their service and advice.</p>

<p>In autumn, Tracy received a visit from a Green Doctor who advised she turn down her boiler temperature and flow and set her thermostat to a constant 18 degrees rather than turning it on high when she comes in from the cold.</p>

<p>Tracy used to pay £1 a day for her gas, but after the Green Doctor visited she only paid 14 pence per day, allowing her to save hundreds of pounds over the year! This means Tracy can now use the money she saved to do fun activities with her grandchildren during the summer.</p>

<p>You too can get a FREE Green Doctor visit, find out more and book your home visit: <a href="https://www.groundwork.org.uk/fivecounties/green-doctor/">https://www.groundwork.org.uk/fivecounties/green-doctor/</a></p>

It’s a website run by The Wildlife Trust where you can find oodles of information on how to run an effective community group, including information on governance, but also everything from engaging with local businesses to making your own compost!</p>
