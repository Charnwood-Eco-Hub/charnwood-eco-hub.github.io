<h1 id="chesterton-house-donates-1000-for-essential-equipment-at-charnwood-eco-hub">Chesterton House Donates Â£1,000 for Essential Equipment at Charnwood Eco Hub</h1>

<p>We are delighted to announce a generous Â£1,000 donation from <a href="https://chestertonhouse.co.uk/foundation/">Chesterton House Financial Planning</a>, which will go towards purchasing essential equipment for the Charnwood Eco Hub.</p>

<p>This funding will enable us to invest in tools, materials, and resources vital for our workshops, community events, and sustainability projects. From gardening supplies to eco-education materials, this equipment will empower the hub to provide hands-on experiences and foster environmental awareness across Charnwood.</p>

<p>Thank you also to everyone who has contributed so far, including Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free for their kind donations recently, and to everyone who has added to our crowdfunder campaign. We have reached almost 50% of our Justgiving target, so if you would like to support us and havenâ€™t yet gotten around to it, here is the <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/charnwood-ecohub">link</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/environment-action-volunteers.jpg" alt="Environment Action Volunteers" /></p>

<p>Leicestershire County Council are currently recruiting for new Environment Action Volunteers (including Master Composters) in Leicestershire. No previous experience of volunteering is necessary nor do you need to have any prior knowledge of waste or environmental topics to apply, although having an interest would be beneficial. Full training will be given.</p>

<p>To join the Environment Action Volunteer (EAV) scheme you must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A Leicestershire resident (this excludes residents of Leicester City and Rutland owing to the way the EAV scheme is funded)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aged 18 years or over (for insurance purposes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have an interest in helping Leicestershire residents / communities to reduce waste, recycle more, protect and improve the environment and to live more sustainably</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All our EAVs are covered by appropriate insurance. Approved expenses including travel and mileage costs incurred in performing the voluntary role are reimbursed.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://leicestershirecountycouncil.goassemble.com/opportunities/77850-environment-action-volunteer-2024-12-11">Less Waste website</a> for more info on the roles and what is involved.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/eco-volunteers.jpg" alt="Share Your Eco Events with Us!" /></p>

<h1 id="share-your-eco-events-with-us">Share Your Eco Events with Us!</h1>

<p>Do you have an upcoming event focused on sustainability, environmental awareness, or community action? Weâ€™d love to hear about it!</p>

<p>The Charnwood Eco Hub is dedicated to connecting people with opportunities to get involved in making a greener future. Thatâ€™s why we feature a â€˜Whatâ€™s Onâ€™ section in our newsletter, highlighting eco-friendly events happening across Charnwood.</p>

<p>Whether itâ€™s a workshop, clean-up day, educational talk, or market, sharing your event helps us spread the word and inspire more people to participate.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org">Email us</a> your event details to be included in the next edition. Letâ€™s work together to build a more sustainable Charnwood!</p>
