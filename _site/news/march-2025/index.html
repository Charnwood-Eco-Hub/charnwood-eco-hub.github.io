<h1 id="the-criminalisation-of-environmental-protest">The Criminalisation of Environmental Protest</h1>

<p>Lecture by Sir Jonathon Porritt
Loughborough University
March 11th, 6.30-8pm</p>

<p>Sir Jonathon Porritt CBE is an eminent writer and campaigner on sustainable development. Over his career, he has played a major role in helping to promote the importance of sustainability issues to government, the private sector and amongst the general public. He has provided strategic advice to leading UK and international companies to deepen their understanding of today‚Äôs converging environmental and climate crises.</p>

<p>He is also focused on intergenerational justice, supporting young people in their activities around sustainable development issues as they face a future defined by the twin crises of the Climate Emergency and Biodiversity Emergency.</p>

<p>Jonathon was formerly Co-Chair of the Green Party (1980-83) and Director of Friends of the Earth (1984-90). He stood down as Chair of the UK Sustainable Development Commission in 2009, after nine years providing high-level advice to Government Ministers.</p>

<p>Jonathon was awarded a CBE in January 2000 for services to environmental protection.</p>

<p>In his guest lecture at Loughborough University, Jonathon will discuss the criminalisation of environmental protest, looking at instances of arrests, imprisonment and similar in cases such as Just Stop Oil in the UK and beyond.</p>

<p>Students, staff and members of the public are all welcome to attend. There will be an opportunity for questions during the event. Please submit any questions you may have in advance.</p>

<p>The session will be hosted by Professor John Downey, Associate Pro Vice-Chancellor for Climate Change and Net Zero.</p>
