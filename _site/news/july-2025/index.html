<p><strong>Welcome to the July edition of the Charnwood Eco Hub newsletter!</strong> ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒž</p>

<p>Summer is here, and with it comes a packed calendar of exciting events and new developments at the Hub! Weâ€™re delighted to invite you to our vibrant programme of <strong>creative and sustainable workshops</strong> over the coming months, including a <strong>bike repair workshop</strong>, a hands-on <strong>fabric journal roll session</strong>, a <strong>slow sashiko-style stitching workshop</strong>, and an inspiring <strong>talk on sustainable fashion</strong>. Thereâ€™s something for everyoneâ€”whether youâ€™re looking to learn a new skill, connect with others, or live more sustainably.</p>

<p>We also want to do a shout out to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/Barrow-Greener-Living/100090737682207/">Barrow Greener Living</a> for hosting their first Clothes Swap - which we provided clothes rails and hangers for, and to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thefixitgroup">The Fix It Group 23</a> for their World Earth Day Repair Cafe, which received coverage from BBC Radio Leicester. Weâ€™re also thrilled to be <strong>supporting Loughborough PRIDE</strong> next monthâ€”celebrating inclusion, community, and sustainability with pride. ðŸŒˆ</p>

<p>Looking ahead, weâ€™re already gearing up for our <strong>Sustainability Fair in September</strong>, so save the date - Sunday 21st September - more details coming soon!</p>

<p>In exciting news, weâ€™ve recently been <strong>awarded funding by Loughborough University</strong> to purchase a <strong>smoothie bike</strong>, which weâ€™ll be <strong>repurposing as a seed bomb bike</strong> to bring along to eventsâ€”combining fun, fitness, and environmental action in one!</p>

<p>Donâ€™t forget to check out our <strong>refill station range</strong>, which is proving so popular we will soon be offering even more eco-friendly options to help you reduce waste. And please note: <strong>our opening hours have changed</strong>, so be sure to check the updated times before you drop by!</p>

<p>Thanks, as always, for being part of the Charnwood Eco Hub community. Weâ€™re looking forward to a brilliant month with you all!</p>

<h1 id="exciting-additions-to-our-refill-station">Exciting Additions to Our Refill Station!</h1>

<p>Weâ€™re expanding our refill station to offer even more ways to reduce waste and live sustainably! You can now refill your own containers with <strong>shampoo, conditioner, fabric conditioner</strong>, and <strong>toilet cleaner</strong> â€” eco-friendly essentials without the plastic waste.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re also going to be stocking a lovely range of <strong>handmade dishcloths, make-up remover pads</strong>, and other sustainable accessories, perfect for everyday low-waste living - coming soon!</p>

<p>Donâ€™t have your own bottles? No problem! We now sell <strong>reusable plastic bottles</strong> with either spray nozzles or pump tops to suit your needs. We also have a small number of <strong>free repurposed bottles</strong> availableâ€”first come, first served!</p>

<p>If you have any <strong>clean, empty plastic bottles</strong> at home (especially with spray or pump tops), weâ€™d be so grateful for your donations to help us keep the reuse cycle going.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s keep working together to cut down on single-use plasticsâ€”one refill at a time!</p>

<h1 id="plastic-free-july-small-steps-big-impact">Plastic Free July: Small Steps, Big Impact</h1>

<p>Every piece of plastic we refuse, replace, or recycle is a vote for a cleaner planet. This <strong>Plastic Free July</strong>, letâ€™s challenge ourselves to break up with single-use plastics and embrace more sustainable habits.</p>

<p>Here are a few easy ways to start:</p>

<p>âœ… Carry a reusable water bottle and coffee cup<br />
âœ… Say no to plastic straws and cutlery<br />
âœ… Bring your own bags to the Hub<br />
âœ… Try bar soap and shampoo bars instead of bottled, or visit our Refill Station!<br />
âœ… Buy in bulk and choose loose produce</p>

<p>Plastic pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges of our timeâ€”but together, our choices <em>do</em> make a difference.</p>

<p>Join the movement. Inspire others. Go plastic free this Julyâ€”and maybe beyond ðŸ’ªðŸŒ±</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/">Plastic Free July</a> website for more resources or to make a pledge.

<h1 id="new-opening-hours">New Opening Hours</h1>

<p>Weâ€™ve updated our opening hours to better reflect when we can offer you the best serviceâ€”thanks to the time and energy of our amazing volunteers! You can now visit us on <strong>Wednesdays from 4â€“8pm (access via our Clarence Street entrance opposite Travis Perkins, stairs only, no access to car park), Thursdays from 10amâ€“1pm</strong>, and <strong>Saturdays from 10amâ€“2pm</strong>. As we are an entirely volunteer-run organisation, our opening times depend on the availability of our team. We really appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to grow our community-led Hub.

<h1 id="were-looking-for-volunteers--come-join-our-team">Weâ€™re Looking for Volunteers â€“ Come Join Our Team!</h1>

<p>The Charnwood Eco Hub is powered by passionate people, and weâ€™re currently looking for new volunteers to help us grow and thrive. Whether you have a few hours a week or can just lend a hand occasionally, your time and skills can make a real difference. Our <strong>general hub shift volunteers</strong> help keep the space welcoming and running smoothlyâ€”chatting to visitors, restocking the refill station, and supporting day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re also on the lookout for <strong>event volunteers</strong> to help out at our upcoming <strong>Sustainability Fair in September</strong> and our <strong>Christmas Eco Market in November</strong>. From setting up and packing down to helping with activities and welcoming guests, itâ€™s a great way to get involved and be part of something positive.</p>

<p>If you have skills in <strong>donor or community engagement, fundraising, social media, or marketing</strong>, weâ€™d love your help behind the scenes too! Weâ€™re keen to build stronger connections with our supporters, raise awareness of what we do, and reach more people across Charnwood. Whether youâ€™re a people person, a creative thinker, or just someone who wants to pitch in, thereâ€™s a role for you here.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in getting involved or would just like to chat about the possibilities, check out our opportunities <a href="https://volunteer.valonline.org.uk/volunteer-today/">here</a>, drop us an <a href="mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org">email</a> or come and speak to us at the Hub â€” weâ€™d love to hear from you!</p>
