We are both passionate about the planet, and have both been involved in environmental projects locally for some time.\n\nWe identified a need to bring together local environmental organisations and initiatives and to raise awareness of them amongst local residents, in order to help them to reduce their own carbon footprint and live more sustainably.\n\nWe're really pleased to introduce our new director, Clive Bagley. Clive has been a director at DIAM, an international manufacturer of tailor-made point-of-sale solutions for over 30 years, so brings a wealth of experience to our little board. He's also a part time tinkerer, and he'll also be taking responsibility for the Makerspace project in our new Eco Hub."

Sources include food from supermarkets, local food businesses, producers, households and gardens. \n\nCharnwood Community Fridge are planning to make Christmas-New Year food bags for families in need, especially pensioners and those who we are not entitled to get support from elsewhere. To continue their collective commitment to recycling and green living, they are looking for donated fabrics so that their volunteers can make bags out of them.\n\nThey would be very grateful if you could support them by donating either surplus or used fabrics still in good condition.

If you'd rather just donate, you can do so by donating to our Justgiving page [here](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/charnwood-ecohub).\n \n\n![Sustainable Christmas poster](/assets/img/sustainable-christmas.png)\n\nAs the festive season approaches, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement and excesses of Christmas. However, with a little thought and creativity, you can enjoy the holidays while reducing waste, cutting emissions, and protecting our beautiful planet. Here are some simple yet impactful ways to make your Christmas sustainable, brought to you by Charnwood Eco Hub.\n\n1\\. Rethink Your Decorations\n\nInstead of buying new decorations each year, consider using natural, recyclable, or homemade alternatives. Pinecones, dried oranges, cinnamon sticks, and sprigs of holly or evergreen branches make beautiful, biodegradable ornaments. Visit our tree at All Saints' Christmas Tree Festival for inspiration! If you have existing decorations, treasure them\u2014they're often more meaningful and sustainable than mass-produced alternatives.\n\n2\\. Choose Eco-Friendly Wrapping\n\nThe UK generates a staggering amount of waste during Christmas, much of it from wrapping paper. Opt for recyclable kraft paper, reusable fabric wraps, or even old maps and newspapers to wrap your gifts. Skip the glitter\u2014it\u2019s non-recyclable\u2014and finish with natural twine or a reusable ribbon. Or come along to one of our eco gift wrapping sessions (see what's on below) and let us wrap them for you!\n\n3\\. Give Thoughtful, Sustainable Gifts\n\nSupport local artisans, ethical brands, or give experiences instead of physical gifts. Think workshop vouchers, concert tickets, or a donation to a charity in the recipient's name. Homemade gifts like jams, baked goods, or knitted scarves can also add a personal and eco-conscious touch.\n\n4\\. Feast Sustainably\n\nA Christmas feast can be both delicious and eco-friendly. Plan portions carefully to avoid food waste, source ingredients locally, and consider a plant-based menu or dishes. If you have leftovers, get creative with recipes or share them with neighbors and friends.\n\n5\\. Reduce Energy Usage\n\nLighting adds a magical touch to Christmas, but it can also use significant energy. Switch to LED fairy lights, and put them on a timer to reduce consumption. Turn off unnecessary lights and appliances to conserve energy while enjoying the holiday glow.\n\n6\\. Rent, Don\u2019t Buy\n\nIf you\u2019re hosting and need extra furniture, crockery, or even outfits, consider renting instead of purchasing new items that might only be used once. Many local rental services offer beautiful and functional items for a fraction of the cost\u2014and environmental impact\u2014of buying new.\n\n7\\. Opt for a Sustainable Tree\n\nReal trees, when responsibly sourced from local growers, are generally more eco-friendly than artificial ones. Look for FSC-certified trees, or consider renting a living tree that can be replanted after the holidays. If you already have an artificial tree, the best thing you can do is keep using it for as many years as possible.\n\n8\\. Recycle and Repurpose\n\nOnce the festivities are over, recycle what you can and repurpose decorations for next year. Compost your natural tree or check if your council offers a tree recycling scheme. By properly sorting waste, you ensure that materials are reused and kept out of landfills.\n\n9\\.

No sooner had we finished getting everything ready for the Sustainability Fair, were we into last minute preparations for next month's Christmas Eco Market - if you haven't heard about that yet, see the article below, it's going to be brilliant.

Over 30 stalls participated, including local craftspeople selling sustainable handmade gifts, local groups such as Transition Loughborough, Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free and Incredible Edible offering advice on how to live more sustainably, national and local environmental charities like the Trent Rivers Trust sharing information on their activities, and entertainment from local performers The Quorn Ukulele Orchestra, Bare Bones Women\u2019s Morris Dancers and Sing It Happy choir.\n\nThis year for the first time food was available, from new local community interest company Turnip Point - who make delicious dishes out of food otherwise destined for landfill - and Food for Future, who were hosting cookery demonstrations on how to cook vegan on a budget with seasonal produce. Fun and educational family activities were provided by Parents for Future. Charnwood Borough Council, who supported the event, were also present, with 500 native trees to give away to residents to plant at home.\n\nWe\u2019re really pleased that the event went so well and particularly that the weather held \u2013 Mother Nature must have been smiling on us! It was great to see so many people at the event - even more than last year - and chatting to stall holders, who said they had some really positive conversations. One of the aims of Charnwood Eco Hub is to bring local groups working towards sustainability together, and help them to share information on their activities with residents, so we\u2019re delighted that so many people engaged, and we\u2019re already making plans for next year. We\u2019d also like to thank Charnwood Borough Council for supporting this event.\n\n\n# Charnwood Eco Hub/SOFA collab October update!\n \n![Charnwood Eco Hub team with the SOFA trustees](/assets/img/charnwood-eco-hub-sofa-collaboration.jpg)\n\nThings are moving along nicely with our Eco Hub fit out project, and we hope to get started on getting some walls up soon! We met with the trustees at SOFA last month to give them an update on our progress, and everyone was very excited to hear about our plans. Clive is busy drawing up floor plans, and we have been contacting/visiting local organisations organisations and businesses, for support either as donors or collaborators. We hope to have something to show you next month - Watch this space!\n\n\n# Christmas Eco Market\n\n![Christmas Eco Market poster](/assets/img/christmas-eco-market.png)\n\nOur next event is a Christmas Eco Market, which will take place in Loughborough Market Place (using the new permanent covered market stalls) on Sunday November 3rd from 10am-3pm. Charnwood Borough Council will be there giving away trees again, which always draws a crowd, we hope to have some Christmas-themed entertainment, and we'll be offering an eco gift-wrapping service. We are particularly looking for stalls selling ethical/sustainable Christmas gifts, and vegetarian/vegan food stalls - If you'd like to come, you can book a stall [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKnbgxTxKBcZXkcQ5RoXsCCm-Jc1uAh2cm8lDqqiHZe4Zs4Q/viewform).\n\n\n# Transition Potato Day 2025\n\n![Photo of potatoes being harvested](/assets/img/transition-potato-day-2025.png)\n \nGardeners of Loughborough: it is time to start making your Potato Day orders for the 2025 season!  We are once again partnering with Transition Chesterfield to offer a range of seed potatoes, onions, shallots, garlic, beans, peas, green manure seeds and other veg growing sundries. You can pre-order from today until Tuesday 12th November 2024 if you want to take advantage of the widest range of options and lowest prices.\n\nAs usual pre-ordered items will be collected from Chesterfield in January by the Transition Loughborough volunteers, bagged up and then distributed on Saturday 25th January 2025 from John Storer House.  Full details, and the link to the ordering website at Transition Chesterfield are on our [Potato Day 2025 web page](https://transitionloughborough.wordpress.com/potato-day-2025/).\n\nRemember: you have to place your orders by Tuesday 12th November 2024 \u2013 no orders will be accepted after that date because Transition Chesterfield will be sending the total order amounts of potatoes, sets, and seeds to their suppliers. The deadline is a little earlier this year because the suppliers have already said there are limited stocks of some varieties due to the poor weather experienced by some farmers earlier in the year, so we need to \"get in quick\"! Please don\u2019t get caught out \u2013 order as soon as you can!\n\n\n# Support us and win with Charnwood Community Lottery!\n\n![Charnwood Community Lottery](/assets/img/charnwood-community-lottery-poster.png)\n\nYou can now support us and also be in with a chance of winning by buying tickets for Charnwood Community Lottery.

Our approach? Simple \u2013 we rescue surplus food, turn it into innovative meals, and share it with the community through various concepts, making healthy, innovative, delicious food accessible to all.\n\nOur recent launch event at the Charnwood Eco Hub Sustainability Fair on 29th September at Queens Park was a fantastic start! It was the perfect way to introduce ourselves to the community, and the response was incredible. With the help of Fareshare, Wonky Veg, who generously donated a box of produce, and some local traders we managed to save 120kg of food that would have otherwise gone to waste. \n\nThe money raised from each event goes directly into growing Turnip Point, allowing us to host more community events, provide more delicious food offerings, and help even more people through our free community lunches and dinners. Our mission is to keep spreading sustainability and community spirit with every meal we serve! All support on our journey is very much appreciated - You can support our crowdfunder [here](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/turnippoint).\n\nWhat\u2019s Next? We\u2019re excited to announce our next event at the Hub Project on Market Street (Loughborough) on Monday, 7th October from 12-2 PM. This pay-as-you-please lunch is open to everyone! Come enjoy our delicious meat and veggie options made from surplus ingredients, and take the opportunity to see the fantastic work the Hub Project is doing inside for the local community. It\u2019s first come, first serve, so come down early to grab a meal, enjoy some good food, and be part of something bigger. And don\u2019t worry if you miss it, we\u2019ll be back at the next Charnwood Eco Hub Sustainability Fair in November.\n\n[Follow us](https://www.instagram.com/turnip.point/), join the movement, and let\u2019s make a real difference together!\nWe can\u2019t wait to see you at our next event!\n\n[www.turnippoint.co.uk](https://www.turnippoint.co.uk)\n\n\n# International Repair Day 2024 - Saturday 19th October\n \n![Repair Day poster](/assets/img/repair-day-2024.png)\n\nRepairing things isn\u2019t always easy \u2013 especially with electricals and electronics!\nIt\u2019s often hard to get spare parts; there are limited instructions; items aren\u2019t made to last and some are impossible to take apart without breaking them. This isn\u2019t just frustrating, it\u2019s bad for our bank balances and the planet.  On Saturday 19 October 2024 we will celebrate the eighth edition of International Repair Day, a day to promote and celebrate the value of fixing. We've signed the Repair and Reuse declaration, calling on policymakers to make it easier for items to be repaired. If you run a repair cafe or repair group, please consider signing it. \n\nWoodhouse Eaves Plastic Free have organised a special International Repair Day Repair Cafe in Woodhouse Eaves Village Hall on the day from 9.30am-12.30pm, and we'll be making a special announcement on the day ourselves, so keep an eye on our social media!\n\n\n# Coming up\n\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| ![MMC Repair Cafe logo](/assets/img/mmc-repair-cafe-logo.png){:width=\"400px\"}<br/> | **MMC Repair Cafe**<br/> *6th October*<br/> 10.00AM-1.00PM<br/> Mountsorrel Memorial Centre |\n| ![Turnip Point launch poster](/assets/img/turnip-point-poster.jpg){:width=\"400px\"}<br/> | **Turnip Point Community Lunch**<br/> *Monday 7th October*<br/> The Arc Community Centre |\n| ![Fruit Routes logo](/assets/img/fruit-routes-logo.png){:width=\"400px\"}<br/> | **Fruit Routes Harvest Event**<br/> *Saturday 12th October 12-5pm*<br/> Loughborough University Campus |\n| ![Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free logo](/assets/img/woodhouse-eaves-plastic-free-logo.png){:width=\"400px\"}<br/> | **Repair Cafe**<br/> *Saturday 19th October, 9.30am-12.30pm*<br/> Woodhouse Eaves Village Hall |\n\n\n# Volunteer with us!\n\n![Volunteering opportunities with Charnwood Eco Hub](/assets/img/support-us.jpg)\n\nWe're looking for volunteers to join us at the Eco Hub in a wide variety of roles, including customer service, admin, social media & marketing, and tech support, and we'd love to welcome you to the team!

He stood down as Chair of the UK Sustainable Development Commission in 2009, after nine years providing high-level advice to Government Ministers.\n\nJonathon was awarded a CBE in January 2000 for services to environmental protection.\n\nIn his guest lecture at Loughborough University, Jonathon will discuss the criminalisation of environmental protest, looking at instances of arrests, imprisonment and similar in cases such as Just Stop Oil in the UK and beyond.\n\nStudents, staff and members of the public are all welcome to attend.

Whether you\u2019re borrowing from our [Library of Things](/projects/library-of-things), finding hidden treasures in the [Scrapstore](/projects/scrapstore), or would like to volunteer with us, we\u2019re here for it! **Our opening hours** are:\n\n\ud83d\udd70\ufe0f Wednesday: 4 PM \u2013 8 PM<br/>\n\ud83d\udd70\ufe0f Thursday 10 AM - 2 PM<br/>\n\ud83d\udd70\ufe0f Saturday: 10 AM \u2013 2 PM<br/>\n\n\ud83d\udccd Find us on the first floor at SOFA, Towles Mill Building, Clarence Street, Loughborough, LE11 1DY.\n\nStay tuned for exciting events, workshops, and community projects happening soon.

Julian Rees will give a talk on the importance of looking after our soil.\n\n A handful of healthy soil contains more living organisms than all the humans that have ever lived.  It stores more carbon than the atmosphere and all plants and animals combined.  It is essential to providing our food.  Yet we are losing it at a terrifying rate.  Globally we lose 24 billion tonnes per year.  Understanding soil is fundamental to growing healthy, nutritious food.\n\nAfter a talk on soil and how to keep it healthy, we will look at some samples of different soils, pick it up, run it through our fingers, look at it, smell it, discuss texture and colour.\n\nNo charge, but donations to cover costs will be appreciated. Please arrive early.  Bring gardening gloves if you can but we can provide.  Booking essential.  Email on [ediblelboro@gmail.com](mailto:ediblelboro@gmail.com) to book.\n\nParking around Fearon Hall is limited. Best option is to park under Tesco\u2019s in The Rushes and walk up, leaving 5 minutes or more for the walk.\n\n\n![Greener Future Leicestershire](/assets/img/greener-future-leicestershire.jpg){:width=\"85%\"}\n\nGreenerFuture Leicestershire is a newly launched Innovate UK funded project to deliver carbon reduction services across the county. Their vision is to offer fully funded credible advice and effective support to businesses and communities to build a more resilient and greener future. Their business advisory service provides guidance to businesses and community organisations,  for whatever stage of the sustainability journey your group or business is at.\n\nTheir services offer a comprehensive support package to Leicestershire SMEs and community groups, to:\n\n* Focus on what sustainability action is relevant for you - Use their diagnostic tool to identify 3 practical actions that will make the biggest difference to your business\n* Learn from trusted resources  - they provide materials to help you save time and make informed decisions on how to take the best actions for your business\n* Join expert-led workshops - Fully funded hands-on support and opportunities to connect with others on the same journey\n* Get recognised for your sustainability actions\n* Stand out and succeed with recognition for your work\n\nStart your journey at [www.greenerfutureleicestershire.co.uk](https://www.greenerfutureleicestershire.co.uk) or email them at [greenerfuture@leicester.ac.uk](mailto:greenerfuture@leicester.ac.uk).\n\n\n\n![Leicestershire Waste Prevention Map](/assets/img/leicestershire-waste-prevention-map.jpg)\n\n# Leicestershire County Council Launches Waste Prevention Map\n \nThis new interactive map hosted on the County Council website includes organisations that provide refill options on food and drinks, repairers such as fixer groups and other organisations in the community (like us!) that support a move to a more local circular economy where waste is eliminated and products are kept in use for longer.\n \nA spokesperson for the County Council said, \"We know sometimes it is difficult to find a service near you without lots of searching, so we have created this map so you can find the services you need across Leicestershire.\"\n \nLeicestershire County Council has recently launched a new waste prevention map to help residents find their nearest repair cafe, refill shop or eco group.  The map shows organisations that are based in Leicestershire who help people to;\n \n* Reduce\n* Reuse\n* Refill\n* Prevent Waste\n\nIf you belong to a Leicestershire-based organisation that fits one of these categories, and you're not on the map, you can add your group by filling in the application form [here](https://www.lesswaste.org.uk/reuse/waste-prevention-reuse-map/).\n\n\n\n![Seed Swap](/assets/img/seed-swap-logo.jpg)\n\nCalling all gardeners: Transition Loughborough are holding another of their popular seed share events at Fearon Hall!\n\nThis will take place in the morning on Saturday 1st March 2025 and will coincide with a vegan cafe popping up in the Hall serving breakfasts, so you can do some seed sharing and eat some plants at the same time.\n\nFor those who have not been before, a seed sharing event is when local people bring unwanted seeds they have, put them on tables and then look at other seeds people have put down. Any that take your fancy you can have. You can bring 1 packet and take 10, or bring 10 and take 1, and the seeds can be self-saved ones or out of date, partially used or unwanted commercial seed packets. Its a great way to thin out your excess old seeds stock and potentially pick up some seeds to try out for free. No money changes hands for the seed swap itself, though you'll need to buy your breakfast at the Fearon Hall cafe.\n\n\n\n![Charnwood Sustainability Fair 2025](/assets/img/sustainability-fair-2025.png)\n\n# Applications Open!\n\nPlanning ahead for a greener future?

By installing solar panels and producing renewable electricity for your home or business, you will be playing your part in supporting our shared ambition to reduce carbon emissions in Leicestershire.\n\nThe Council has partnered with independent experts in group-buying, iChoosr Ltd, to bring this opportunity to Charnwood's homeowners.\n\nSolar Together Leicestershire is an innovative scheme offering high-quality solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and battery storage. It is a group-buying scheme, which brings Leicestershire households together to get high-quality solar panels at a competitive price, helping you through the process and keeping you informed at every stage.\n\nRegistration for this round closes on **Friday August 9, 2024**.\n\nFind out more about how the scheme works, who is eligible, and how to register by visiting the Solar Together website. \n\n[Find out more and how to apply](https://solartogether.co.uk/charnwood/home)\n\n\n![Groundwork Five Counties logo](/assets/img/five-counties-logo.png)\n\nTo support Leicestershire residents with their energy bills, regional charity Groundwork Five Counties is offering their FREE Green Doctor service, with home appointments now available to book.\n\nThese energy efficiency experts identify and tackle damp, mould, heat loss, leaks, and other issues in your home. They give bespoke advice that works for you, along with energy-saving measures such as LED bulbs, draught-proofing items, and more - to save further money on your energy bills. \n\nIf you are eligible, they can also help you access emergency heating, government grants for large purchases (incl. boiler replacement, solar panels, improved insulation), support you with debts, and more. They are a fount of knowledge around local support available that may be helpful to you, and you are sure to be happy with their service and advice.\n\nIn autumn, Tracy received a visit from a Green Doctor who advised she turn down her boiler temperature and flow and set her thermostat to a constant 18 degrees rather than turning it on high when she comes in from the cold.\n\nTracy used to pay \u00a31 a day for her gas, but after the Green Doctor visited she only paid 14 pence per day, allowing her to save hundreds of pounds over the year! This means Tracy can now use the money she saved to do fun activities with her grandchildren during the summer.\n\nYou too can get a FREE Green Doctor visit, find out more and book your home visit: [https://www.groundwork.org.uk/fivecounties/green-doctor/](https://www.groundwork.org.uk/fivecounties/green-doctor/)\n\n \n![Nextdoor Nature Hub logo](/assets/img/nextdoor-nature-hub-logo.png)\n\nAre you a community group focused around nature?

More than 15 groups were in attendance on the day, including  Incredible Edible, Transition Loughborough, Loughborough University, Loughborough Climate Action and Barrow Greener Living Group. The event was intended to offer local groups the opportunity to make connections and talk about potential cross over and collaborations. The idea was conceived after last year's inaugural Sustainability Fair, where the various groups who ran stalls at the event were so overwhelmed with enquiries from the public that they didn't get the opportunity to chat with each other. We also had a representative from Charnwood Borough Council along,chatting to groups about potential funding opportunities for their activities and projects. If you're involved with a local eco group and would like to be included on our mailing list to be kept informed of future events, or would like us to share information about your group and events on our website or Facebook page, please [get in touch](mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org).\n\n\n# Loughborough's Beacon Bingo Hall listed as asset of community value\n\n![The Beacon Bingo building](/assets/img/beacon-bingo-community-asset.jpg)\n\nCharnwood Eco Hub has successfully applied to Charnwood Borough Council to list the former Beacon Bingo Hall as a community asset.  Originally opened as a cinema in 1936 as part of the Odeon cinema chain, the building was subsequently converted to a social club in 1969, after which it became a bingo hall, until its eventual closure in 2021. In order to qualify as a community asset, a building must have been used for community benefit in the recent past. Its listing means that should the owners decide to sell, local community organisations are given the opportunity to put a bid together to buy it. Listing a property doesn\u2019t prevent the sale of the building, nor does it limit the use that it can be put to by the current owners.\n\nThe building is also Grade II listed as a building of architectural significance \u2013 it is a remarkably well preserved and accomplished example of the 1930s modernist cinema style employed by the Odeon cinema chain, at that time, style leaders in cinema design. The small car park adjacent to the Bing Hall has recently been opened as a pay and display car park, creating valuable additional town centre parking spaces.\n\nA representative of Charnwood Eco Hub, who applied for the building to be listed, said, \"The former Beacon Bingo hall is an iconic building. We asked for it to be listed as a community asset so that if the current owners ever decide to sell, the community has an option to put a bid together to offer to buy it on behalf of the town and maintain its use for the social benefit of local residents, which has been its sole purpose up to this point. So many socially historic buildings have been converted into flats or offices, and whilst we\u2019d of course rather see this beautiful building put to any use rather than allowed to fall into disrepair, it would be amazing if it could continue to be a community space. We would love to hear what people\u2019s favourite memories are of the building.\" [Contact us](mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org) to share your memories of the Beacon Bingo Hall.\n\n\n# Volunteer with us!\n\n![Volunteering opportunities with Charnwood Eco Hub](/assets/img/support-us.jpg)\n\nWe're looking for volunteers to join us at the Eco Hub in a wide variety of roles, including customer service, admin, social media & marketing, and tech support, and we'd love to welcome you to the team!

        "content": "**Charnwood Eco Hub has successfully applied to Charnwood Borough Council to list the former Beacon Bingo Hall as a community asset**\n\n![The Beacon Bingo building](/assets/img/beacon-bingo-community-asset.jpg)\n\nOriginally opened as a cinema in 1936 as part of the Odeon cinema chain, the building was subsequently converted to a social club in 1969, after which it became a bingo hall, until its eventual closure in 2021. In order to qualify as a community asset, a building must have been used for community benefit in the recent past. Its listing means that should the owners decide to sell, local community organisations are given the opportunity to put a bid together to buy it. Listing a property doesn\u2019t prevent the sale of the building, nor does it limit the use that it can be put to by the current owners.\n\nThe building is also Grade II listed as a building of architectural significance \u2013 it is a remarkably well preserved and accomplished example of the 1930s modernist cinema style employed by the Odeon cinema chain, at that time, style leaders in cinema design. The small car park adjacent to the Bing Hall has recently been opened as a pay and display car park, creating valuable additional town centre parking spaces.\n\nA representative of Charnwood Eco Hub, who applied for the building to be listed, said, \u201cThe former Beacon Bingo hall is an iconic building. We asked for it to be listed as a community asset so that if the current owners ever decide to sell, the community has an option to put a bid together to offer to buy it on behalf of the town and maintain its use for the social benefit of local residents, which has been its sole purpose up to this point. So many socially historic buildings have been converted into flats or offices, and whilst we\u2019d of course rather see this beautiful building put to any use rather than allowed to fall into disrepair, it would be amazing if it could continue to be a community space. We would love to hear what people\u2019s favourite memories are of the building.\u201d [Contact us](/contact) to share your memories of the Beacon Bingo Hall."

Over 30 stalls participated, including local craftspeople selling sustainable handmade gifts, local groups such as Transition Loughborough, Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free and Incredible Edible offering advice on how to live more sustainably, national and local environmental charities like the Trent Rivers Trust sharing information on their activities, and entertainment from local performers The Quorn Ukulele Orchestra, Bare Bones Women\u2019s Morris Dancers and Sing It Happy choir. This year for the first time food was available, from new local community interest company Turnip Point - who make delicious dishes out of food otherwise destined for landfill - and Food for Future, who were hosting cookery demonstrations on how to cook vegan on a budget with seasonal produce. Fun and educational family activities were provided by Parents for Future. Charnwood Borough Council, who supported the event, were also present, with 500 native trees to give away to residents to plant at home.\n\nWe\u2019re really pleased that the event went so well and particularly that the weather held \u2013 Mother Nature must have been smiling on us! It was great to see so many people at the event - even more than last year - and chatting to stall holders, who said they had some really positive conversations. One of the aims of Charnwood Eco Hub is to bring local groups working towards sustainability together, and help them to share information on their activities with residents, so we\u2019re delighted that so many people engaged, and we\u2019re already making plans for next year.
