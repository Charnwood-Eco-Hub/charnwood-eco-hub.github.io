**The countdown has begun!**

Less than a month to go until our Sustainability Fair, and we can't wait to let you all in on some of the eco treats we have in store for you! We will have edible delights and cookery demonstrations, lovingly crafted gifts and makes from local artisans, family-friendly eco themed activities, entertainment from local performers, information on how to live more sustainably, and Charnwood Borough Council will be running a free tree giveaway.  Sunday 29th September, 10am-3pm, Queen's Park, Loughborough - and it's free!
