**We have some exciting plans in the offing, and we would love to hear what you think about them!**

We are currently involved in talks with another local charity about an exciting collaboration that will involve setting up a physical Eco Hub in Loughborough, out of which we hope to operate a Tool Library, Makerspace (or Hackspace) and a Scrapstore, as well as offering a space for local eco/sustainability groups to hold meetings and small events or workshops.

We would love to hear what you think about our idea, and gather some feedback on how you would use the space, either as an individual or as an organisation.

You can fill in our online survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeunNy8gA1OsdnYPz8d7KdB6WS-FWnLnyFCXdhRkUbLU5cR7A/viewform). Please do share the link widely, as the more feedback we can get the better!

If you're interested in getting involved in this project, please do [get in touch](/contact), we'd love to hear from you!
