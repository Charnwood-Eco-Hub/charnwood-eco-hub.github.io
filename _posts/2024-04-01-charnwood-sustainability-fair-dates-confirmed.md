**After the huge success of our first Sustainability Fair last year with the support of Charnwood Borough Council, we've confirmed the date for this year**

This year's Sustainability Fair will take place on Sunday 29th September in Queen's Park Loughborough from 10am-3pm.

We will have stalls representing a variety of local sustainability and eco groups, including Transition Loughborough, Incredible Edibles, etc. sharing information on their projects, how you can get involved and how you can lower your own carbon footprint, as well as entertainment, workshops and local small businesses selling sustainable products and gifts, like Men & Women in Sheds, Buckingham Bees and Real Refills.

More information will be released closer to the time. If you're interested in a stall at this year's fair, please fill in the [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTu-HmTfaZ4_FrDv7zaPaH_mOjxmKNdRYPEyvUMgBSLuDnRw/viewform). 

This year, we'll also be running an Eco Christmas market on Sunday 3rd November, in Loughborough Market Place from 10am-2pm.

This will be an ideal opportunity for people to buy sustainable, locally made gifts and crafts, and we're also hoping to be able to run one or two sustainable Christmas craft workshops on the day.
