**You can now recycle your used ink cartridges with us!**

We can take any brand of printer cartridges, but cannot accept laser or toner cartridges. We can exchange used cartridges for cash via Charity.co.uk - all funds raised will go to the Eco Hub. You can drop off your cartridges at Purple Pumpkin Patch on Ashby Road for now, until we are fully set up in our new home!
