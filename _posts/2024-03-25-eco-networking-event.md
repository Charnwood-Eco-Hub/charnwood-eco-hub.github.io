**Charnwood Eco Hub recently held a networking event for local groups involved in projects that support sustainability or protect and enhance the local environment**

More than 15 groups were in attendance on the day, including  Incredible Edible, Transition Loughborough, Loughborough University, Loughborough Climate Action and Barrow Greener Living Group.

The event was intended to offer local groups the opportunity to make connections and talk about potential cross over and collaborations. The idea was conceived after last year's inaugural Sustainability Fair, where the various groups who ran stalls at the event were so overwhelmed with enquiries from the public that they didn't get the opportunity to chat with each other.

We also had a representative from Charnwood Borough Council along,chatting to groups about potential funding opportunities for their activities and projects.

If you're involved with a local eco group and would like to be included on our mailing list to be kept informed of future events, or would like us to share information about your group and events on our website or Facebook page, please [get in touch](/contact).
