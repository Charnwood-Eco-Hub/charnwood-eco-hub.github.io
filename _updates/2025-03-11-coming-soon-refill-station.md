**Coming soon - Refill Station**

![Refill Station](/assets/img/refill-station.jpg)

We're excited to announce that Charnwood Eco Hub will soon be launching a new refill station! In response to the sad closure of Real Refills (and many thanks to Sandra for her guidance), we know many of you have been looking for a local, sustainable way to top up your household essentials. Our new station will offer a range of eco-friendly cleaning products, helping you reduce plastic waste and shop more sustainably. We're running this as a pilot to gauge interest, so will look to expand our range if it proves popular. Stay tuned for more details—we can’t wait to bring this much-needed service to our community!
