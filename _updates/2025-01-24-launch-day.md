**We’re thrilled to announce the official launch of the Charnwood Eco Hub!**

The hub will be open for the first time to the general public on Saturday, 1st February 2025, from 10am until 2pm, offering an exciting day of activities and an opportunity for people to learn more about becoming a member of the Scrapstore and the Library of Things, and the benefits that both offer.

We hope you’ll join us for our opening weekend!!

**Towles Mill Building, Clarence Street, Loughborough, LE11 1DY**
