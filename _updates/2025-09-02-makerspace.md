Weâ€™re excited to announce that our new **makerspace** is coming together â€” a place where creativity, craftsmanship, and community meet. To make it happen, weâ€™re looking for skilled and enthusiastic people who can help us set things up and get everything running smoothly.

If youâ€™ve got experience in woodworking, metalworking, electronics, workshop setup, or just a knack for problem-solving, weâ€™d love to hear from you!

**Hereâ€™s what we already have in the workshop:**

- Laser Cutter
- Vacuum Former
- Industrial Sewing Machine & Overlocker
- Vinyl cutter
- Pillar Drill
- Lathe
- CNC Router
- Table Saw
- 3D printers
- Electric planer
- A growing set of hand tools

**And hereâ€™s whatâ€™s on the way:**

- Bench saw
- Band Saw
- Belt Sander
- Knitting machine
- Soldering Stations
- More specialist tools and equipment as we expand

Weâ€™re building more than just a workshop â€” weâ€™re building a community resource. By volunteering your time and skills now, youâ€™ll be helping lay the foundations for a space where people can learn, share, and make amazing things together.

Letâ€™s create something incredible â€” together.
