**We've just launched a Justgiving campaign to help us raise funds towards our project of setting up a Library of Things, Scrapstore & Makerspace in Charnwood**

Imagine a place where you can borrow all sorts of useful things — tools, equipment, craft supplies, and even materials to get creative and make something new. A space where nothing goes to waste, and everyone has access to what they need, without the burden of buying things that will only be used once. That’s the vision for Charnwood's very own Library of Things, Scrapstore and Makerspace, and we need your support to bring it to life!

By donating to our crowdfunding campaign, you’ll be helping us create a community hub that promotes sustainability, reduces waste, and provides accessible resources for everyone. Whether you’re a DIY enthusiast, a creative crafter, a small business owner, or someone simply looking to borrow tools for a one-time project, our Library of Things, Scrapstore and Makerspace will be there for you.

Together, we can build a resourceful, creative, and eco-friendly space right here in Charnwood. Join us in making this vision a reality—because when we share, we all thrive!

Help raise £5,000 to Help Us Build a Library of Things, Scrapstore & Makerspace in Charnwood!
