# The Charnwood Eco Hub Scrapstore 

![Charnwood Eco Hub Scrapstore](/assets/img/scrapstore-1.jpg)

The Charnwood Eco Hub Scrapstore Project is a creative and sustainable initiative designed to reduce waste and inspire creativity within the community. We collect surplus materials and offcuts from local businesses, preventing them from going to landfill and offering them to individuals, families, and organisations at an affordable price. Whether you're a teacher, artist, parent, or community group leader, the Scrapstore is a treasure trove of crafting supplies, educational materials, and unique items for upcycling projects.

Our Scrapstore operates on an annual membership basis, making it easy for everyone to access these valuable resources while supporting sustainability efforts. Memberships are priced affordably: £10 for individuals on a low income, £15 for individuals and families, and £40 for organisations such as schools, charities, or businesses. Members enjoy unlimited visits to the Scrapstore, where they can fill a basket of scrap materials for just £5, making it a cost-effective way to fuel your creative projects.

For those who would like to explore the Scrapstore without committing to a membership, day passes are also available, giving everyone the opportunity to experience the joy of finding unique and affordable materials. By joining or visiting the Scrapstore, you save money, reduce waste, and help foster a more environmentally conscious community.

Come visit us at the Charnwood Eco Hub to see how you can turn scrap into something extraordinary or sign up to become a member today. Together, we can make creativity sustainable!
