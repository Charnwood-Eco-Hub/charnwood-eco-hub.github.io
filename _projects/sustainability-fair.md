This year’s Sustainability Fair will take place on Sunday 21st September 2025 in Queen’s Park Loughborough from 10am-3pm, highlighting green initiatives and fostering community collaboration.

This much-anticipated event is a perfect opportunity for local businesses, organisations, and artisans to showcase their sustainable products and and eco-friendly services, and their knowledge and projects.

We will have stalls representing a variety of local sustainability and eco groups, including Transition Loughborough, Incredible Edibles, etc. sharing information on their projects, how you can get involved and how you can lower your own carbon footprint, as well as entertainment, workshops and local small businesses selling sustainable products and gifts, like Men & Women in Sheds and Buckingham Bees.

Don’t miss your chance to be part of these inspiring events! <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2mnGIMpkyc2NDdWitvRAt_lU1gaLYp078gaHj2V_p6TcmGw/viewform">Apply now</a> to help shape a sustainable Charnwood.
