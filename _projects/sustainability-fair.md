The fair is a celebration of positive action - bringing together people who care about the environment, community wellbeing, and practical solutions for more sustainable living.

We invite you to come and join us in Queens Park, Loughborough on May 3rd 2026 from 10AM to 3PM for conversation, inspiration, activities and ideas.
