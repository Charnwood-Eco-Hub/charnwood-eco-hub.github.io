# Be Part of Bringing Our Makerspace to Life!

![Makerspace signage going up](/assets/img/charnwood-eco-hub-signage.jpg){:width="75%"}

Youâ€™ve already heard us talk about our plans for a community Makerspace â€“ a place where people can come together to learn, share, and create. Now, weâ€™re at the stage where we need some extra hands and hearts to help make it happen!

Weâ€™re looking for people whoâ€™d like to get involved in getting the space up and running. That could mean helping with set-up, sharing your skills and knowledge, lending tools or equipment, or simply being part of the team that makes the Makerspace a reality.

This is a great chance to help shape a community resource that will inspire creativity and skill-sharing for years to come. Whether youâ€™re a maker, fixer, crafter, teacher, or just enthusiastic about the idea â€“ weâ€™d love to hear from you.

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™d like to get involved, please [get in touch](https://charnwoodecohub.org/).
