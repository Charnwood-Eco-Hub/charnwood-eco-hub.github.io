We’re excited to launch our brand-new [Party Kit](https://www.partykitnetwork.org/uk/charnwoodecohub), designed to make hosting easier, more affordable, and more eco-friendly.

For just **£10 for a week**, you can hire:

- **30 place settings** (plates, cups, bowls, cutlery)

- Colourful **bunting** to brighten up your space

- A ready-to-use **Pass the Parcel kit** for guaranteed fun!

But that’s not all — Also available through our [Library of Things](/projects/library-of-things/), you can hire extras to take your party to the next level, including a **bingo set**, a **karaoke machine**, a **tin can alley**, and even a **prize wheel**.

And if you’re looking for crafty ways to decorate or keep guests entertained, don’t forget we’ve got **lots of crackers and supplies in the Scrapstore** too!
