# The Charnwood Eco Hub Library of Things

Charnwood Eco Hub's Library of Things is an exciting initiative that helps you save money, reduce waste, and embrace a more sustainable lifestyle. Instead of buying items you may only use occasionally, why not borrow them? Our Library of Things offers a wide range of useful items for hire at an affordable price, making it easy to access the tools, equipment, and household items you need without the expense or clutter of ownership. From DIY tools and gardening equipment to kitchen appliances and party supplies, we’ve got you covered! Examples of what you can borrow include power drills, lawnmowers, sewing machines, carpet cleaners, and even items like gazebos or slow cookers.

Memberships are available on an annual basis, with fees set at £10 for individuals on a low income and £15 for individuals or families. Once you’re a member, you can hire items from the library for a small charge per item, helping to cover maintenance and ensure our collection stays in excellent condition. Whether you’re tackling a one-off DIY project, hosting a special event, or trying out something new without committing to a purchase, the Library of Things is here to make life more affordable and eco-friendly.

Join us at the Charnwood Eco Hub or sign up now and discover how borrowing can transform the way you live, work, and play. Let’s reduce waste, share resources, and build a more sustainable future together!
