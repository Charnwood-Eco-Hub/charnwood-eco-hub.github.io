Charnwood Eco Hub CIC
We are Charnwood Eco Hub, a new Community Interest Company set up by friends Sarah Goode and Emma Ward.

We are both passionate about the planet, and have both been involved in environmental projects locally for some time.

We identified a need to bring together local environmental organisations and initiatives and to raise awareness of them amongst local residents, in order to help them to reduce their own carbon footprint and live more sustainably.
