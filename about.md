**About Us**

{% include gallery caption="Emma Ward (left) and Sarah Goode (right)" %}

We are Charnwood Eco Hub, a new Community Interest Company set up by friends Sarah Goode and Emma Ward.  We are both passionate about the planet, and have both been involved in environmental projects locally for some time.

We identified a need to bring together local environmental organisations and initiatives and to raise awareness of them amongst local residents, in order to help them to reduce their own carbon footprint and live more sustainably.

We're really pleased to introduce our new director, Clive Bagley. Clive has been a director at DIAM, an international manufacturer of tailor-made point-of-sale solutions for over 30 years, so brings a wealth of experience to our little board. He's also a part time tinkerer, and he'll also be taking responsibility for the Makerspace project in our new Eco Hub.
