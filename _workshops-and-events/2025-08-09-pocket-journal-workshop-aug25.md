# Pocket Journal Workshop
 
Join us from 11AM to 1PM on Saturday 9th August 2025 and learn to make you own pocket journal book using various papers such as recycled, handmade, maps and music sheets.

Fill the pockets with tags, cards and tickets. This will be a book and you can continue to create and decorate. Make for yourself or as a personalised gift for someone.

Spend a fulfilling afternoon learning and creating in a relaxed environment and discover the satisfaction of handmade art.

The workshop costs Â£15 and includes all materials. You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Pocket Journal Workshop](https://pay.sumup.com/b2c/QGPLXPTZ)
