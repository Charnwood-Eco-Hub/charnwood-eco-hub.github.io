You will have the opportunity to make this item personal and sentimental by adding pieces of your own fabrics, buttons, beads, and broken jewellery.

This unique item will be a keepsake you can proudly take home.  Spend a fulfilling afternoon learning and creating in a relaxed environment and discover the satisfaction of handmade art.

The workshop costs Â£15 and includes all materials. You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Fabric Journal Roll Workshop](https://pay.sumup.com/b2c/QI9WSMQO)
