Discover the art of slow stitching and making a beautiful sari fabric journal roll. You will have the opportunity to make this item personal and sentimental by adding pieces of your own fabrics, buttons, beads, and broken jewellery. This unique item will be a keepsake you can proudly take home.  Spend a fulfilling afternoon learning and creating in a relaxed environment and discover the satisfaction of handmade art.
