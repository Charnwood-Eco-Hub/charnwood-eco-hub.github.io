# Sustainable Fashion Workshop
 
**Have clothes you don’t want to give up? Maybe from a beloved parent or child?**

Something you fancied from a charity shop but didn’t fit? Shrunken wool sweaters?

Join us from 6PM to 8PM on Wednesday 17th September 2025 for a talk, demonstration and sharing of ideas on rescuing, altering and upcycling fabric.

_Bring your own garments if you wish._

Keen upcycler Suella Postles will share her enthusiasm for making sure things have the longest life possible. Lots of examples of fabric reuse.

Light Refreshments. £5 to book a place.

You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Sustainable Fashion Workshop](https://pay.sumup.com/b2c/QIDDEGEQ)
