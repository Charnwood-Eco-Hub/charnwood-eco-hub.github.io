# Celebrating Our First Year
 
![Eco Hub first birthday poster](/assets/img/eco-hub-first-birthday-feb-2026-poster.png)

Come and join us at the Eco Hub to mark one year of sharing skills, reducing waste, and building a more sustainable community together. To say thank you, we're inviting everyone to join us for tea and cake, and a free bird feeder making activity.

The bird feeder activity is suitable for ages but children must be supervised by an adult at all times. This is a relaxed, drop in event with no need to book.

As an extra birthday bonus, anyone who signs up in person for a Scrapstore membership on the day, will receive a free basket.

We'd love you to come along and celebrate with us.
