<h1 id="sustainable-fashion-workshop">Sustainable Fashion Workshop</h1>

<p><strong>Have clothes you don’t want to give up? Maybe from a beloved parent or child?</strong></p>

<p>Something you fancied from a charity shop but didn’t fit? Shrunken wool sweaters?</p>

<p>Join us from 6PM to 8PM on Wednesday 17th September 2025 for a talk, demonstration and sharing of ideas on rescuing, altering and upcycling fabric.</p>

<p><em>Bring your own garments if you wish.</em></p>

<p>Keen upcycler Suella Postles will share her enthusiasm for making sure things have the longest life possible. Lots of examples of fabric reuse.</p>

<p>Light Refreshments. £5 to book a place.</p>
