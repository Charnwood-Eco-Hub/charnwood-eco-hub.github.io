<h1 id="make-a-morsbag">Make a Morsbag</h1>

<p>Join us on Saturday 14th June 2025 from 11AM to 1PM for a hands-on sewing session where you’ll create your own Morsbag – a reusable, strong, and eco-friendly bag made entirely from recycled fabric that would otherwise go to landfill.</p>

<p>Each participant will make at least two Morsbags: one to keep and one to gift – spreading the message of sustainability. If you’re quick and make more than two, you’re welcome to keep them or take any unfinished ones home.</p>

<p>All materials will be provided, including pre-cut fabric, thread, and official Morsbag labels. Please bring your own fabric scissors if you have them. An iron and ironing board will be available at the venue.</p>

<p><strong>Important Info:</strong></p>

<p>🧵 Basic sewing experience is required – you should be comfortable using a sewing machine and rethreading it if needed. The sewing itself is simple (straight lines), but this session is not suitable for complete beginners.</p>

<p>👥 Ages 18+ only.</p>

<p>🧷 Sewing machines are available at the venue; workshop numbers will be limited accordingly.</p>

<p>♻️ Morsbags are a fantastic way to reduce single-use plastic. Each one is unique, washable, and designed to last for years.</p>

<p>Let’s sew, chat, and make a real difference – one bag at a time!</p>

<p>The workshop costs £15 per person and includes all materials. You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - <a href="https://pay.sumup.com/b2c/QHTO09YF">Morsbag Making Workshop</a>.</p>
