# Creative Journalling Workshop
 
Join us from 11AM to 1PM on Saturday 25th October 2025 for a fun and interactive creative journalling workshop with Sam Berry, where you'll explore unique techniques to using collage.

All materials are provided, but feel free to bring along a magazine to use in your collage if you'd like. Spaces are limited, so be sure to book in advance!

You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Creative Journalling Workshop](https://pay.sumup.com/b2c/QFQUN3KF)
