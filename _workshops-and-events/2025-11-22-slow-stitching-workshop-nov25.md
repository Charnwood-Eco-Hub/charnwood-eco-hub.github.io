# Slow Stitching Workshop
 
Join us from 11AM to 1PM on Saturday 22nd November 2025 for a Slow Stitching Workshop.

**Using simple stitching, we calm our emotions and enjoy the tactile rhythm of eachstitch rather than rushing to finish.**

You'll choose fabric scraps that speak to you, sew them together intuitively, and embrace imperfections along the way - because this workshop is about presence, not perfection.

The workshop costs Â£15 and includes all materials. You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Slow Stitching Workshop](https://eventbookings.com/b/event/slow-stitching-workshop)
