# Rag Rug Workshop
 
Join us from 11AM to 1PM on Saturday 27th September 2025 and learn how to make a rag rug.

**Slow down. Weave memories. Take something meaningful home.**

Learn this traditional technique by creating a small sample piece - perfect for beginners. No experience needed.

All material provided, using recycled fabric from the Scrapstore - or bring your own to reimagine.  Â£15 per person.

You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Rag Rug Workshop](https://www.eventbookings.com/b/event/rag-rug-taster-workshop)
