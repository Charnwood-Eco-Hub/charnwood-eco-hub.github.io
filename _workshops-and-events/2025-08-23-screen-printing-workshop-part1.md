# Screenprinting Workshop - Part 1
 
Join us from 11AM to 1PM on Saturday 23rd August 2025 for the first half of our screenprinting workshop. £15 per person.

This 2-hour screenprinting workshop will guide participants through designing and preparing their own screens, ready to move on to part two. You can book on this class without booking onto part two, but please note we won’t be printing.

**Learn to make your own design and screen.**

You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Screenprinting Workshop Part 1](https://www.eventbookings.com/b/event/screenprinting-workshop-part-one)
