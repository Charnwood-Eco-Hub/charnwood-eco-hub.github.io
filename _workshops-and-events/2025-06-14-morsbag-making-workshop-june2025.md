# Make a Morsbag

Join us on Saturday 14th June 2025 from 11AM to 1PM for a hands-on sewing session where you‚Äôll create your own Morsbag ‚Äì a reusable, strong, and eco-friendly bag made entirely from recycled fabric that would otherwise go to landfill.

Each participant will make at least two Morsbags: one to keep and one to gift ‚Äì spreading the message of sustainability. If you're quick and make more than two, you're welcome to keep them or take any unfinished ones home.

All materials will be provided, including pre-cut fabric, thread, and official Morsbag labels. Please bring your own fabric scissors if you have them. An iron and ironing board will be available at the venue.

**Important Info:**

üßµ Basic sewing experience is required ‚Äì you should be comfortable using a sewing machine and rethreading it if needed. The sewing itself is simple (straight lines), but this session is not suitable for complete beginners.

üë• Ages 18+ only.

üß∑ Sewing machines are available at the venue; workshop numbers will be limited accordingly.

‚ôªÔ∏è Morsbags are a fantastic way to reduce single-use plastic. Each one is unique, washable, and designed to last for years.

Let‚Äôs sew, chat, and make a real difference ‚Äì one bag at a time!

The workshop costs ¬£15 per person and includes all materials. You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Morsbag Making Workshop](https://pay.sumup.com/b2c/QHTO09YF).
