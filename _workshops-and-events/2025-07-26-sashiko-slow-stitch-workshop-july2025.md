# Sashiko-Style Slow Stitch Workshop
 
Join us from 11AM to 1PM on Saturday 26th July 2025 to discover the mindful art of slow stitching, inspired by Japanese Sashiko.

Create a unique patch for denim, a jar topper, a framed abstract piece - or simply enjoy the meditative processs.

No experience needed. Basic sewing skills helpful but not essential. All materials provided - or bring your own item to embellish.

Slow down. Stitch memories. Take something meaningful home.

The workshop costs Â£15 and includes all materials. You can book in person in the Hub, using the QR code on the poster below or here - [Sashiko-Style Slow Stitch Workshop](https://pay.sumup.com/b2c/QLFZ0JJC)
