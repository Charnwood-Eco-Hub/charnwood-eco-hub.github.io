# Paper Flower Making Workshop
 
Join us from 11.00AM to 1.00PM on Saturday 11th October 2025 and learn how to make **Creatively Crafted Paper Roses.**

_In this workshop you will be creating gorgeous paper roses and I will show you three ways of adding colour to your flowers._

You will be able to mount your flower in a deep box frame once it is thoroughly dry. No prior painting experience needed.

Â£15 per person. Suitable for 10 years+, with an accompanying adult.
