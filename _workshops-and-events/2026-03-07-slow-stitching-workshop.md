# Charnwood Eco Hub Slow Stitching workshop

*Using simple stitching, we calm our emotions and enjoy the tactile rhythm of each stitch rather than rushing to finish.*

You’ll choose fabric scraps that speak to you, sew them together intuitively, and embrace imperfections along the way — because this workshop is about presence, not perfection.

You can book by scanning the QR code on the poster or [here](https://www.eventbookings.com/b/event/slow-stitching-workshop-6978be437a9fa9-11220393).
