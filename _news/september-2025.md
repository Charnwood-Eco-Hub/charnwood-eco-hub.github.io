# September 2025 Newsletter

**Welcome to the September Edition of the Charnwood Eco Hub Newsletter!**

September is shaping up to be an exciting month for us. Our superstar volunteers Janet Smith and Ben Mondair were nominated for Charnwood Community Heroes awards and had a **wonderful time celebrating at the awards ceremony last week**, along with other amazing volunteers from across the borough. Looking ahead, weâ€™re excited to welcome you to the **Sustainability Fair on Saturday 21st September**, where weâ€™ll be sharing ideas, inspiration, and practical steps for greener living. Our **Eco Shop has had a big refresh**, making it easier than ever to find sustainable swaps and community-made goods. Weâ€™re also thrilled to introduce our brand new **Smoothie Bike**â€”which we have plans for beyond whipping up thirst-quenching drinks!

On top of that, weâ€™ve got a line-up of **upcoming workshops** designed to help you learn new skills, connect with others, and put sustainability into practice.

Read on for all the detailsâ€”we canâ€™t wait to see you soon!

# Charnwood Eco Hub Sustainability Fair - Sunday 21st September

Save the date! This yearâ€™s **Sustainability Fair** returns to **Queenâ€™s Park, Loughborough** on **Sunday 21st September**, running from **10am to 3pm**. Itâ€™s going to be a full day of inspiration, action, and community â€” a chance for everyone to come together in exploring greener ways of living.

_What to Expect:_

**Local stalls & green initiatives**

Discover whatâ€™s happening locally: meet groups like _Transition Loughborough, Incredible Edibles_ and many others. Learn about their work, their goals, and how you can get involved. 

**Sustainably made products & gifts**

Browse craft stalls, eco-businesses, and artisans selling sustainable goods. Things like locally-made gifts, eco-friendly homewares, and handmade items from small makers like Buckingham Bees, The Owl Wood Shed and Purple Pumpkin Patch. 
 
**Workshops & activities**

Engaging, hands-on sessions for all ages and interests: learn tips for lowering your carbon footprint, repair-oriented workshops, creative reuse, etc.

**Entertainment & community**

It wonâ€™t just be stalls â€” there will be entertainment from the likes of Sing it Happy, Pandy Bat, and Chandra Yoga, opportunities to connect with neighbours, enjoy the atmosphere, maybe grab something to eat from The Greekery or Food for a Future and make a day of it.

We hope to see you there â€” letâ€™s make this yearâ€™s fair our biggest and greenest yet!

# Be Part of Bringing Our Makerspace to Life!

Youâ€™ve already heard us talk about our plans for a community Makerspace â€“ a place where people can come together to learn, share, and create. Now, weâ€™re at the stage where we need some extra hands and hearts to help make it happen!

Weâ€™re looking for people whoâ€™d like to get involved in getting the space up and running. That could mean helping with set-up, sharing your skills and knowledge, lending tools or equipment, or simply being part of the team that makes the Makerspace a reality.

This is a great chance to help shape a community resource that will inspire creativity and skill-sharing for years to come. Whether youâ€™re a maker, fixer, crafter, teacher, or just enthusiastic about the idea â€“ weâ€™d love to hear from you.

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™d like to get involved, please [get in touch](https://charnwoodecohub.org/).
