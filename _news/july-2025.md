# July 2025 Newsletter

**Welcome to the July edition of the Charnwood Eco Hub newsletter!** ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒž

Summer is here, and with it comes a packed calendar of exciting events and new developments at the Hub! Weâ€™re delighted to invite you to our vibrant programme of **creative and sustainable workshops** over the coming months, including a **bike repair workshop**, a hands-on **fabric journal roll session**, a **slow sashiko-style stitching workshop**, and an inspiring **talk on sustainable fashion**. Thereâ€™s something for everyoneâ€”whether you're looking to learn a new skill, connect with others, or live more sustainably.

We also want to do a shout out to [Barrow Greener Living](https://www.facebook.com/people/Barrow-Greener-Living/100090737682207/) for hosting their first Clothes Swap - which we provided clothes rails and hangers for, and to [The Fix It Group 23](https://www.facebook.com/thefixitgroup) for their World Earth Day Repair Cafe, which received coverage from BBC Radio Leicester. Weâ€™re also thrilled to be **supporting Loughborough PRIDE** next monthâ€”celebrating inclusion, community, and sustainability with pride. ðŸŒˆ

Looking ahead, weâ€™re already gearing up for our **Sustainability Fair in September**, so save the date - Sunday 21st September - more details coming soon!

In exciting news, weâ€™ve recently been **awarded funding by Loughborough University** to purchase a **smoothie bike**, which weâ€™ll be **repurposing as a seed bomb bike** to bring along to eventsâ€”combining fun, fitness, and environmental action in one!

Donâ€™t forget to check out our **refill station range**, which is proving so popular we will soon be offering even more eco-friendly options to help you reduce waste. And please note: **our opening hours have changed**, so be sure to check the updated times before you drop by!

Thanks, as always, for being part of the Charnwood Eco Hub community. Weâ€™re looking forward to a brilliant month with you all!

# Exciting Additions to Our Refill Station!

We're expanding our refill station to offer even more ways to reduce waste and live sustainably! You can now refill your own containers with **shampoo, conditioner, fabric conditioner**, and **toilet cleaner** â€” eco-friendly essentials without the plastic waste.

Weâ€™re also going to be stocking a lovely range of **handmade dishcloths, make-up remover pads**, and other sustainable accessories, perfect for everyday low-waste living - coming soon!

Donâ€™t have your own bottles? No problem! We now sell **reusable plastic bottles** with either spray nozzles or pump tops to suit your needs. We also have a small number of **free repurposed bottles** availableâ€”first come, first served!

If you have any **clean, empty plastic bottles** at home (especially with spray or pump tops), weâ€™d be so grateful for your donations to help us keep the reuse cycle going.

Letâ€™s keep working together to cut down on single-use plasticsâ€”one refill at a time!

# Plastic Free July: Small Steps, Big Impact

Every piece of plastic we refuse, replace, or recycle is a vote for a cleaner planet. This **Plastic Free July**, letâ€™s challenge ourselves to break up with single-use plastics and embrace more sustainable habits.

Here are a few easy ways to start:

âœ… Carry a reusable water bottle and coffee cup<br/>
âœ… Say no to plastic straws and cutlery<br/>
âœ… Bring your own bags to the Hub<br/>
âœ… Try bar soap and shampoo bars instead of bottled, or visit our Refill Station!<br/>
âœ… Buy in bulk and choose loose produce

Plastic pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges of our timeâ€”but together, our choices _do_ make a difference.

Join the movement. Inspire others. Go plastic free this Julyâ€”and maybe beyond ðŸ’ªðŸŒ±

Visit the [Plastic Free July](https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/) website for more resources or to make a pledge.

# New Opening Hours

Weâ€™ve updated our opening hours to better reflect when we can offer you the best serviceâ€”thanks to the time and energy of our amazing volunteers! You can now visit us on **Wednesdays from 4â€“8pm (access via our Clarence Street entrance opposite Travis Perkins, stairs only, no access to car park), Thursdays from 10amâ€“1pm**, and **Saturdays from 10amâ€“2pm**. As we are an entirely volunteer-run organisation, our opening times depend on the availability of our team.

# We're Looking for Volunteers â€“ Come Join Our Team!

The Charnwood Eco Hub is powered by passionate people, and weâ€™re currently looking for new volunteers to help us grow and thrive. Whether you have a few hours a week or can just lend a hand occasionally, your time and skills can make a real difference. Our **general hub shift volunteers** help keep the space welcoming and running smoothlyâ€”chatting to visitors, restocking the refill station, and supporting day-to-day operations.

Weâ€™re also on the lookout for **event volunteers** to help out at our upcoming **Sustainability Fair in September** and our **Christmas Eco Market in November**. From setting up and packing down to helping with activities and welcoming guests, itâ€™s a great way to get involved and be part of something positive.

If you have skills in **donor or community engagement, fundraising, social media, or marketing**, weâ€™d love your help behind the scenes too! Weâ€™re keen to build stronger connections with our supporters, raise awareness of what we do, and reach more people across Charnwood. Whether you're a people person, a creative thinker, or just someone who wants to pitch in, there's a role for you here.

If you're interested in getting involved or would just like to chat about the possibilities, check out our opportunities [here](https://volunteer.valonline.org.uk/volunteer-today/), drop us an [email](mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org) or come and speak to us at the Hub â€” weâ€™d love to hear from you!
