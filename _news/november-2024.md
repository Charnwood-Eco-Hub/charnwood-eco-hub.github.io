# November 2024 Newsletter

*Hello! We've had a really busy month this month here at the Eco Hub - planning for our Christmas Eco Market (tomorrow!), meeting local organisations (Equality Action, who we were able to donate a sewing machine to, Leicester College, Loughborough University, Men & Women In Sheds), doing work in the building...We've welcomed two new social media volunteers, Sherry &  Sunny, who have been doing an amazing job promoting the Christmas market, and Emma has written a post for the University's Sustainability Blog, 'Sustainably Speaking', talking about International Repair Day. She also gave a presentation on our plans to staff at Nottingham Community Housing Association. If you'd like us to come and talk to your group about what we're doing, please get in touch, we'd love to!*

# Christmas Eco Market

Our Christmas Eco Market will take place in Loughborough Market Place this Sunday November 3rd from 10am-3pm, and we're feeling the festive spirit! We have 30+ local, sustainable makers and craftspeople confirmed, selling an array of wonderful planet friendly handmade products that your friends and family will love to receive as gifts. Charnwood Borough Council will be giving away free native trees, we have Christmas-themed entertainment from Sing It Happy Choir and the Folk Folk, and we'll be offering an eco gift-wrapping service.


![Charnwood Community Fridge logo](/assets/img/charnwood-community-fridge.png)
 
A community fridge is a space that’s dedicated to recycling surplus fresh food and stopping it from going to waste. 

Unlike conventional food banks, a fridge is open to all, and anyone can contribute to, or use food from the fridge. Sources include food from supermarkets, local food businesses, producers, households and gardens. 

Charnwood Community Fridge are planning to make Christmas-New Year food bags for families in need, especially pensioners and those who we are not entitled to get support from elsewhere. To continue their collective commitment to recycling and green living, they are looking for donated fabrics so that their volunteers can make bags out of them.

They would be very grateful if you could support them by donating either surplus or used fabrics still in good condition. Together we can make the world greener and our community more resilient especially in a difficult time like this!

To donate, please contact Shelthorpe Family Hub on 0116 305 5247 (Mon-Fri, 9am-3pm)

# Buy Nothing New Month
 
Could you buy nothing new for just one month?

From the water and energy used in production, to the fuel used in delivery, every new item we buy comes with an environmental price tag.  

Buy Nothing New Month returns this November as we call on Brits to boycott Black Friday and the culture of impulse buys that goes along with it. Instead, we want to waste less, make the most of the stuff we already own, and cut our carbon footprint by buying nothing new – excluding essentials like food and medicine – throughout November.  

Save your pennies, protect the planet, and [sign up](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/i/179557A31835925F) for Buy Nothing New Month today.

# Climate Ambassadors Introduction
## Nov 14th 12.30pm to 1.30pm
 
Staff & students of DeMontfort University and community members are invited to learn about becoming a ‘Climate Ambassador’, part of a UK-wide network who care about sustainability and helping local schools and nurseries to act on climate change. There is a short talk on what’s involved from Matilda Crane, East Midlands lead for the Climate Ambassadors programme, plus information on how DMU staff can use some of the two days of permitted time for volunteering to contribute as Ambassadors. We’ll also signpost upcoming Carbon Literacy Training sessions so you feel confident to help others on climate action.

Where: UN SDG hub, Heritage House 2.05, 61 Southgates, Leicester LE1 5RR

To get involved: Email [dmusdg16@dmu.ac.uk](mailto:dmusdg16@dmu.ac.uk?subject=Climate%20Ambassador) to confirm attendance and put ‘Climate Ambassador’ in the subject field or email [areeves@dmu.ac.uk](mailto:areeves@dmu.ac.uk?subject=Climate%20Ambassador) if you are interested in the scheme but cannot attend the event.
