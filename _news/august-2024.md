# August 2024 Newsletter

*Hello! Another busy month for the Eco Hub team - things are gearing up as we prep for September's Sustainability Fair, and we've been on a team road trip all the way to exotic Nottingham to visit their Hackspace and pick up some tips!*


# Charnwood Eco Hub / SOFA Collab Update!

![Charnwood Eco Hub and SOFA team key handover](/assets/img/charnwood-eco-hub-sofa-keys.jpg)

We're really excited to announce that we've signed a collaboration agreement with SOFA, the furniture reuse charity based in the old Towles Mill building on Nottingham Road in Loughborough. SOFA have offered us  space on the first floor of the building from which to run our tool library, makerspace and scrapstore projects, and we're applying for grants to fund the structural work we need to do internally to make the space safe and secure and ready for business. Watch this space for updates on the build and a launch date!


# Charnwood Sustainability Fair

This year's Sustainability Fair is swiftly approaching, and we're very excited! We've got even more stalls than last year, some returners and some new! We'll also have an activity station with family eco activities all day, B Buddies will be doing free bike checks, Charnwood Borough Council will be giving away free trees, food will be available at Queen's Park Cafe and stalls, and there will be entertainment throughout the day from Quorn Ukulele Orchestra, Sing It Happy Choir, and Morris Dancers.  The fair runs from 10am-3pm in Queen's Park, Loughborough, and entry is free! We have our fingers crossed for the weather, and we hope you'll join us - if you'd like to volunteer to help us out on the day, please drop us an email 
[here](mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org).


![We want to hear from you!](/assets/img/charnwood-eco-hub-wants-to-hear-from-you.png)

We still need more responses to our eco hub survey - we would love to hear what you think about our ideas, and gather some feedback on how you would potentially use the space, either as an individual or as an organisation.  You can fill in our online survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeunNy8gA1OsdnYPz8d7KdB6WS-FWnLnyFCXdhRkUbLU5cR7A/viewform. Please do share the link widely, as the more feedback we can get the better!)


# We need your old printer cartridges!
 
![Printer cartridge recycling](/assets/img/printer-cartridges.jpg)

You can now recycle your used ink cartridges with us! We can take any brand of printer cartridges, but cannot accept laser or toner cartridges. We can exchange used cartridges for cash via Charity.co.uk - all funds raised will go to the Eco Hub. You can drop off your cartridges at Purple Pumpkin Patch on Ashby Road for now, until we are fully set up :-)
