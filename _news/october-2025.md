# October 2025 Newsletter

**Welcome to the October Edition of the Charnwood Eco Hub Newsletter!**

Hello Eco Friends!

Autumn has arrived, and with it comes a flurry of creativity and community spirit here at Charnwood Eco Hub. As the leaves turn golden, we‚Äôre gearing up for an exciting season of sustainable events, hands-on workshops, and eco-conscious shopping!

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce our upcoming [Christmas Eco Market on Sunday 2nd November](/workshops-and-events/christmas-eco-market-nov25/), where local makers, upcyclers, and green-minded creators will showcase eco-friendly gifts and festive treats ‚Äî perfect for a mindful holiday season.

Before the festive rush, why not join us for one of our [creative workshops](/workshops-and-events)? Next Saturday we‚Äôll be hosting a **Creative Journalling workshop** to inspire reflection and mindfulness, as well as a **Christmas Card Making workshop** in November that puts a sustainable twist on traditional crafts.

We‚Äôre also excited to unveil our brand new **Smoothie Bike**, part-funded by the **Loughborough University Community Fund**! This pedal-powered wonder will make its debut at our events, helping to power **paper-making** and **seed bomb-making** activities ‚Äî combining fitness, fun, and sustainability in one spin!

And don‚Äôt forget to pop into our **Hub Shop**, open to everyone and full of **handmade, sustainable gifts** and **eco-friendly kits** created from materials from our scrapstore. One of our new favourites is the **Party in a Box* ‚Äî just ¬£5 and packed with 5 crackers, 5 party poppers, 5 silver and 5 gold party blowers, a set of selfie masks, and a pack of balloons ‚Äî everything you need for a fun, low-impact celebration!

Stay tuned for dates, details, and more ways to get involved. Together, we‚Äôre building a greener, more creative Charnwood community. üå±

![We Want Your Scrap Poster](/assets/img/we-want-your-scrap.png){:width="75%"}

Are you a business with leftover materials or clean scrap you don‚Äôt need? Our local scrapstore is always on the lookout for donations from businesses‚Äîthings like fabric offcuts, cardboard tubes, plastic tubs, packaging, or any other bits and bobs that could be used for crafting and creative play. Instead of sending it to landfill, why not give it a second life in schools, community groups, and art projects? It‚Äôs a great way to reduce waste and support creativity in the local area. If you think you might have something useful, we‚Äôd love to hear from you!

# Be Part of Bringing Our Makerspace to Life!

You‚Äôve already heard us talk about our plans for a community Makerspace ‚Äì a place where people can come together to learn, share, and create. Now, we‚Äôre at the stage where we need some extra hands and hearts to help make it happen!

We‚Äôre looking for people who‚Äôd like to get involved in getting the space up and running. That could mean helping with set-up, sharing your skills and knowledge, lending tools or equipment, or simply being part of the team that makes the Makerspace a reality.

This is a great chance to help shape a community resource that will inspire creativity and skill-sharing for years to come. Whether you‚Äôre a maker, fixer, crafter, teacher, or just enthusiastic about the idea ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to hear from you.

üëâ If you‚Äôd like to get involved, please [get in touch](https://charnwoodecohub.org/).
