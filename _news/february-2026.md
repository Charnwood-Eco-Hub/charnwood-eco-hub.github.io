# February 2026 Newsletter

**Welcome to the February Edition of the Charnwood Eco Hub Newsletter!**

Last weekend we celebrated a huge milestone — Charnwood Eco Hub’s first birthday! It was wonderful to see so many of you through the doors, sharing
cake, stories, and a real sense of community pride. From the Sustainability Fair and workshops to the Scrapstore, Library of Things and reuse
projects, what we’ve built together in just one year is something truly special.

Thanks to your support, volunteering, donations and enthusiasm, we’ve diverted hundreds of tonnes of waste from landfill, created a welcoming space to
learn and connect, and helped make sustainable living more accessible across Charnwood. Whether you’ve popped in once or are here every week — you’re
part of this journey with us.

As we head into February, we’re excited to keep growing, with new activities, workshops, collaborations and opportunities to get involved coming soon.
Here’s to year two — bigger impact, stronger community, and even more positive change 🌱

# HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO US!

Last weekend we marked Charnwood Eco Hub’s first birthday — and what a lovely celebration it was! We welcomed over 60 people through the doors,
filling the hub with conversation, creativity and community spirit.

Sarah was busy signing up lots of new Scrapstore members (welcome everyone!), Emma kept the kettle going with plenty of much-needed cups of tea, and
Katie led a brilliant hands-on activity making bird feeders that proved popular with all ages. It was a perfect snapshot of what the hub is all about
— learning, sharing and connecting in a warm, welcoming space.

Thank you to everyone who came along to celebrate with us, and to all our volunteers who help make the hub what it is every week. We’re so proud of
what’s been achieved in our first year and excited for what’s to come.

💚 **Membership reminder:** If your Scrapstore or Library of Things membership is due to expire soon, please take a moment to renew [here](/projects/scrapstore/) (for Scrapstore) or [here](https://charnwoodecohub.lend-engine-app.com/) (for Library of Things) - your support helps keep the hub running and growing for the whole community.

Here’s to year two!

# Our Workshops Are Back!

Hub Coordinator Katie has been busy putting together our new programme of workshops for 2026, and there are some great opportunities coming up in the
next few months, so watch this space! Kicking us off is our lovely workshop volunteer Kim with her Slow Stitching workshop, which was really popular
last year. Workshops cost £10 if you're a Scrapstore or Library of Things member, and £15 otherwise. This one is just before Mother's Day and would be
a lovely thing to do with a mum. You can book using the QR code on the poster or [here](https://www.eventbookings.com/b/event/slow-stitching-workshop-6978be437a9fa9-11220393).

# Invitation To Stall Holders - Charnwood Sustainability Fair 2026

We are delighted to invite local sustainability, environmental and community-focused organisations, makers and ethical businesses to take part in this year’s **Charnwood Sustainability Fair, which will be held on Sunday 3rd May in Queen's Park Loughborough.**

The fair is a celebration of positive action — bringing together people who care about the environment, community wellbeing and practical solutions
for more sustainable living. It’s a great opportunity to showcase what you do, connect with the local community, and inspire others through
conversation, activities and ideas.

We welcome stallholders offering:

* Environmental and sustainability projects or campaigns
* Repair, reuse, upcycling and circular economy initiatives
* Ethical, local or low-impact products
* Community groups, charities and social enterprises
* Hands-on activities, demonstrations or information stalls

If you’d like to be involved, please [get in touch](mailto:Charnwoodecohub@gmail.com?subject=Sustainability%20Fair) to request a stallholder
application form and further details. Spaces are limited, so early expressions of interest are encouraged.

We’d love you to be part of a friendly, vibrant event that celebrates sustainable living in Charnwood and beyond.

# New Secure Bike Lockers For Loughborough!

There are 20 new secure bicycle storage lockers for cyclists to use around Loughborough town centre.

The lockers are located at:

* Granby Street Car Park, LE11 3DU
* Market Yard, LE11 2PZ
* Loughborough Leisure Centre, Browns Lane, LE11 3HE

The lockers, which were funded through the Government’s UK Shared Prosperity Fund and provided by Spokesafe, are available for £1 per day, £5 per week
or £10 per month. Our very own Cllr Sarah Goode was instrumental in getting them installed. The lockers can accommodate e-bikes as well as standard
push bikes and are designed to fit seamlessly into public spaces and are constructed with a steel frame and sheet metal, clad in wood, offering
excellent protection against theft.

Access to the lockers is managed via a purpose-built locking mechanism connected to the Spokesafe app, allowing users to book and unlock lockers
conveniently through their smartphones. You can make bookings online or via the app. Visit www.spokesafe.com/loughborough to make bookings online
and/or download the app.

How to use the lockers:

- Step 1: Pull down the protective slate.
- Step 2: Press the * button on the bottom left of the keypad.
- Step 3: Enter your 6 digit code from the Spokesafe app.
- Step 4: Pull the handle to unlock the locker.

The Big Plastic Count is the UK’s biggest people-powered investigation into plastic waste. This March, thousands of people from schools, households
and communities across the UK will be counting every piece of plastic packaging they throw away. We’ll then use this evidence to keep pushing the
government to take urgent action to tackle the plastics crisis.

# Group Of The Month: The Fixit Group 23

**The Fix It Group 23 – Leicestershire Repair Café** is a volunteer-led community group helping people repair everyday household items instead of throwing
them away. From small electricals and bikes to clothing, toys and general household fixes, our Repair Cafés bring together skilled volunteers and
local residents to tackle broken items in a friendly, supportive environment.

Our aim is simple: reduce waste, save people money, and share practical repair skills that empower our community. By repairing rather than replacing,
we help cut down on landfill waste and the carbon footprint linked to manufacturing new products — while also encouraging a culture of reuse and care.

We currently run monthly Repair Cafés at the MMC venue in Mountsorrel and at the Bradgate Arms in Cropston. Events are free to attend (donations
welcome) and open to everyone. Alongside fixing items, they’re also a chance to connect with neighbours, learn new skills, and build confidence in
repairing things yourself.

Due to growing demand, we now have a waiting list for volunteer repairers — a great sign of how much support there is for repair in our community.

For event updates, follow us on social media, visit [thefixitgroup23.com](http://thefixitgroup23.com/), or contact us at [thefixitgroup23@gmail.com](mailto:thefixitgroup23@gmail.com).
