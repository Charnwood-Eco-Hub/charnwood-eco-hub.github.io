# Incredible Edible Loughborough Winter Workshops

Announcing our next winter workshop: ‚ÄúSoil: What it is and How to Keep it Healthy‚Äù

 Saturday 22nd February 2025, Fearon Hall, Rectory Road, LE11 1PL, 10am to 12 in the main hall, followed by coffee and chat.  Julian Rees will give a talk on the importance of looking after our soil.

 A handful of healthy soil contains more living organisms than all the humans that have ever lived.  It stores more carbon than the atmosphere and all plants and animals combined.  It is essential to providing our food.  Yet we are losing it at a terrifying rate.  Globally we lose 24 billion tonnes per year.  Understanding soil is fundamental to growing healthy, nutritious food.

After a talk on soil and how to keep it healthy, we will look at some samples of different soils, pick it up, run it through our fingers, look at it, smell it, discuss texture and colour.

No charge, but donations to cover costs will be appreciated. Please arrive early.  Bring gardening gloves if you can but we can provide.  Booking essential.  Email on [ediblelboro@gmail.com](mailto:ediblelboro@gmail.com) to book.

Parking around Fearon Hall is limited. Best option is to park under Tesco‚Äôs in The Rushes and walk up, leaving 5 minutes or more for the walk.

# Leicestershire County Council Launches Waste Prevention Map
 
This new interactive map hosted on the County Council website includes organisations that provide refill options on food and drinks, repairers such as fixer groups and other organisations in the community (like us!) that support a move to a more local circular economy where waste is eliminated and products are kept in use for longer.
 
A spokesperson for the County Council said, "We know sometimes it is difficult to find a service near you without lots of searching, so we have created this map so you can find the services you need across Leicestershire."
 
Leicestershire County Council has recently launched a new waste prevention map to help residents find their nearest repair cafe, refill shop or eco group.  The map shows organisations that are based in Leicestershire who help people to;
 
* Reduce
* Reuse
* Refill
* Prevent Waste

If you belong to a Leicestershire-based organisation that fits one of these categories, and you're not on the map, you can add your group by filling in the application form [here](https://www.lesswaste.org.uk/reuse/waste-prevention-reuse-map/).

![Seed Swap](/assets/img/seed-swap-logo.jpg)

Calling all gardeners: Transition Loughborough are holding another of their popular seed share events at Fearon Hall!

This will take place in the morning on Saturday 1st March 2025 and will coincide with a vegan cafe popping up in the Hall serving breakfasts, so you can do some seed sharing and eat some plants at the same time.

For those who have not been before, a seed sharing event is when local people bring unwanted seeds they have, put them on tables and then look at other seeds people have put down. Any that take your fancy you can have. You can bring 1 packet and take 10, or bring 10 and take 1, and the seeds can be self-saved ones or out of date, partially used or unwanted commercial seed packets. Its a great way to thin out your excess old seeds stock and potentially pick up some seeds to try out for free. No money changes hands for the seed swap itself, though you'll need to buy your breakfast at the Fearon Hall cafe.
