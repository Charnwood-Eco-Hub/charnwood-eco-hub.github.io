We are delighted to announce a generous Â£1,000 donation from [Chesterton House Financial Planning](https://chestertonhouse.co.uk/foundation/), which will go towards purchasing essential equipment for the Charnwood Eco Hub.

This funding will enable us to invest in tools, materials, and resources vital for our workshops, community events, and sustainability projects. From gardening supplies to eco-education materials, this equipment will empower the hub to provide hands-on experiences and foster environmental awareness across Charnwood.

Thank you also to everyone who has contributed so far, including Woodhouse Eaves Plastic Free for their kind donations recently, and to everyone who has added to our crowdfunder campaign.
