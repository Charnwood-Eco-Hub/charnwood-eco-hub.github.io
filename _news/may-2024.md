# May 2024 Newsletter

*Hello! We're back in your inbox, probably sooner than expected! We'll be sending out newsletters on a monthly basis from now on, but we really didn't want you to miss out on some upcoming events, including a Sustainable Living Fair in Woodhouse Eaves on Sunday, and Repair Cafes in May and early June (see upcoming events section at the bottom of the newsletter).*


# Charnwood Sustainability Fair
 
![Charnwood Sustainability Fair 2024 poster](/assets/img/charnwood-sustainability-fair-2024.png)

We still have space for stalls at this year's Sustainability Fair on Sunday 29th September in Queen's Park Loughborough from 10am-3pm. We are looking for stalls representing a variety of local sustainability and eco groups, We had over 1300 people through the park last year, and it's a great opportunity to raise awareness of your group's activities and attract new volunteers. If you're interested in a stall at this year's fair, please fill in the [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTu-HmTfaZ4_FrDv7zaPaH_mOjxmKNdRYPEyvUMgBSLuDnRw/closedform). 

This year, we'll also be running an Eco Christmas market on Sunday 3rd November, in Loughborough Market Place from 10am-2pm.  This will be an ideal opportunity for people to buy sustainable, locally made gifts and crafts, and we're also hoping to be able to run one or two sustainable Christmas craft workshops on the day. If you'd like a booking form for the Christmas Fair, please fill in this [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKnbgxTxKBcZXkcQ5RoXsCCm-Jc1uAh2cm8lDqqiHZe4Zs4Q/viewform).

For more info on either event, or to get involved, please get in touch [here](mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org)) or email [info@charnwoodecohub.org](mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org).


# Volunteer of the month - Jennifer Agu

![Jennifer Agu](/assets/img/jennifer-agu.jpg)
 
We'd like to do a shout out to our wonderful volunteer Jennifer Agu, a postgraduate student at Loughborough University who approached us a few months ago offering her support. Along with helping us out with social media and loads of other key behind the scenes tasks, Jen is a Sustainability Ambassador for the University's Sustainability Team and has just been recognised for her outstanding efforts in that role as well (we honestly don't know how she fits it all in). Thank you for everything you do for us, Jen!  We are always looking for new volunteers, especially if you have expertise in particular areas, but just an extra pair of hands for events and things is welcome too - get in touch to let us know how you could help!


![We want to hear from you!](/assets/img/charnwood-eco-hub-wants-to-hear-from-you.png)

We still need more responses to our eco hub survey - we would love to hear what you think about our ideas, and gather some feedback on how you would potentially use the space, either as an individual or as an organisation.  You can fill in our online survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeunNy8gA1OsdnYPz8d7KdB6WS-FWnLnyFCXdhRkUbLU5cR7A/viewform). Please do share the link widely, as the more feedback we can get the better! If you're interested in getting involved in this project, please do [get in touch](mailto:info@charnwoodecohub.org), we'd love to hear from you!
